Usually Southern part of Sri Lanka is popular for its Malu Ambul thiyal curry. This is why it is called as ‘Dakune malu Ambul Thiyal’.",written byAmila Gamage Wickramarachchi,"September 9, 2011",,,,,,". These spices will dry roast before grinding with gamboge. That recipe is one of the ways cooking fish ambul thiyal in Sri Lanka which I learned from my mother in law. Though that ambul thiyal is a delicious dish, it never gave me the taste of ambul thiyal which I enjoyed in southern part of Sri Lanka. This is why I was curious on cooking this as my grandmother cooked.Sri Lankan Southern Style Fish Ambul ThiyalFinally, I found the secret. In southern ambul thiyal, only goraka, black pepper and salt are used as main ingredients. When you have this paste with all tastes in balance, you can cook delicious fish ambul thiyal with its original unique taste. So, don’t be afraid of tasting your goraka paste before adding to the fish. Adjust salt if needed. Your ambul thiyal paste should give you a taste which is a mix of sour, hot and salty.

I learned this from my mom recently and thought of sharing the recipe again.In Sri Lanka, it is easy to find fish varieties such as Tuna (Bala malu) which is popular as fish type for ambul thiyal. But, any firm fish is suitable for this dish though final outcome will be different.A clay pot is perfect for cooking a delicious ambul thiyal curry. Once cooked, you can easily keep this fish dish for few days without spoiling. Tips to cook Fish Ambul Thiyal1. In Sri Lankan cooking, there is no perfect way for cooking any dish. So, there may have small differences in Ingredients if you check the same recipe from different parts of Sri Lanka.2. Don’t worry about any other ingredients such as cinnamon. They will add aroma and flavour. But, the main flavour is from goraka, black pepper and salt.3. Taste your goraka, pepper and salt paste before adding to fish. In this step, you can adjust salt if needed.4. Instead of pepper powder, use fresh black pepper corn. Freshly grounded black pepper will add more flavour to your curry.5. Don’t worry about banana leaf though it adds aroma to your dish. If you can’t find banana leaf, use curry leaves to the bottom of the clay pot.You can use pandan leaf too. (Rampe)6. While the taste of fish ambul thiyal is a mix of sour, hot and salty taste, the appearance should be in between black and grey.So, below is the recipe for Southern style Sri Lankan Ambul Thiyal.Sri Lankan Southern Style Fish Ambul ThiyalRecipe : Sri Lankan Southern Style Fish Ambul ThiyalIngredients:500g fish (Tuna is most suitable)½ onion – sliced8 tablespoons black pepper10 – 15 pieces gamboge (goraka)2-3 cloves of garlic3-4 sprigs of curry leaves1 inch piece cinnamonsalt – to taste","1.

Katta Sambola (Sri Lankan Chili Paste),"Katta Sambola (Sri Lankan Chili Paste),Katta sambola is a mix of chili,onion and salt which is a main dish of Sri Lankan Cuisine.Sri Lankan recipes online.",written byAmila Gamage Wickramarachchi,"June 20, 2019",,,,,,".Anyway, here are some of the tips to prepare delicious and appealing katta sambol dish.(Sri Lankan Chili Paste)Never use red chili powderAh? never use red chili powder? Yes, never use chili powder if you want to have really appealing katta sambol dish! If you don’t believe me, just search for katta sambol in Google and check the images section. Compare the katta sambol images which made with chili powder and chili flakes. Which one attracts you? You will find the answer.Use dried red chili as it is or use chili flakes.This is opposite for above. A katta sambol with chili seeds will really give you appealing hot and fiery look which katta sambol should have.Grind onion, do not use sliced onionWell, if you don’t have facility to grind onion (if you live in other country), then there is no option, you can use onion cut to small pieces in your katta sambol. Otherwise grind onion using grinding stone or mortar and pestle or electric grinder for better results.Use umbalakada chips (Maldive fish)Well, if you are preparing vegetarian dish, don’t use umbalakada. Otherwise adding umbalakada will enhance the flavor. For Sri Lankan dishes, umbalakada is like using MSG, it is a flavor enhancer. However MSG is not healthy, but our Sri Lankan version is natural and no such healthy risk!But don’t use umbalakada flavours or such which are in the market nowadays which claims to enhance the flavour. Well, at least those are not in my healthy cooking (or at least Sri Lankan true flavouful cooking)Use fresh lime juiceWell, here in Singapore, I also use ‘naran’ (calamansi) for katta sambol. But whenever possible, use natural lime juice for your katta sambol. Not even lemon juice.Lime juice will give you really attracting aroma which is of Sri Lankan katta sambol dish!Did I talk too much today? Well I have some time to write today as my son is still sleeping. 🙂 Finally here is the recipe for Sri Lankan Chili paste.(Sri Lankan Katta Sambol)Katta Sambola (Sri Lankan Chili Paste)Recipe : Katta Sambola (Sri Lankan Chili Paste)Ingredients:1 large onion (Bombay onion) or handful of small red onions2-3 tbsp. of red chili flakes (Alternatively you can use complete dried red chilies with seeds)1 tbsp.

Tofu Roti – A New Face to Sri Lankan Pol Roti,"Tofu Roti - A New Face to Sri Lankan Pol Roti, this is a roti or flatbread cooked with tofu to make it healthy and delicious and vegetarian.",written byAmila Gamage Wickramarachchi,"January 27, 2015",,,,,,". This tofu roti is a result of it. You can even add tofu in your noodles.Pol roti is a Sri Lankan popular flat bread which a dough made with flour and grated coconut is flatten on a pan. Then cook it until both sides are cooked and slightly roasted. I tried to hide tofu in this famous Sri Lankan traditional dish and the result was awesome. Even my husband who tried tofu roti didn’t know that I used some tofu inside it. However, he also commented that roti was soft on that day.Yes, unlike traditional pol roti, this tofu roti is not very hard. It is soft and tastes well inside the mouth.Now, after about 5-6 months of cooking these tofu roti, I thought of sharing the recipe with you all. Please try it and do let me know the outcome.If we talk about tofu, it is made from soybean curd that is pressed into blocks. Tofu has a variety of uses which depend on its different moisture content. Usually soft tofu contains the highest moisture content. Its texture is similar to custard and therefore it is used widely for dessert recipes. Another variety is firm tofu. Firm tofu contains less moisture than soft tofu. Most cooks even use this firm tofu as an alternative for eggs crumbled.If we talk about health benefits of tofu, we cannot ignore its feature of Low in calories and high in protein. Also tofu contains no cholesterol. It also has shown the ability to reduce the risk of heart disease. Considering the above benefits of this amazing food, it’s no wonder that more and more people include tofu food as a part of their healthy lifestyle. So, now it is your turn if you haven’t tried tofu yet. Even if you eat tofu, this tofu roti may be a new recipe for you to try.Below is my version of tofu roti adapted from Sri Lankan pol roti. Please try it and enjoy a healthy meal!Recipe : Tofu RotiIngredients (4-5 nos)2 cups all purpose flour150g Tofu 1 ½ cups fresh grated coconut1 onion sliced1-2 green chili sliced1 sprig of curry leaves sliced2 tbspn butterSalt to taste (about ½ tspn)Water (about ½ cup)","Add all-purpose flour in a mixing bowl.

How to Make Chili Powder,,written byAmila Gamage Wickramarachchi,"March 25, 2014",,,,,,"for Sri Lankan cooking. In a typical Sri Lankan kitchen, we use it as red dried chili, chili powder and as crushed chili flakes. Usually dried red chilies are used for tempering. Red chili powder is for curries and chili flakes are for stir fries.It is really easy to buy red chili powder from a grocery or a super market. Truth is I am on that list. Usually I buy chili powder and I do not prepare it at home. Now I know what you are thinking! You have the doubt of ‘hey why are you sharing this post? A chili powder that you never make at home?’Yes, I don’t prepare it at home. But my mother in law is so helpful and she prepares a big pack of chili powder for me whenever we visited Sri Lanka. Last time I captured few photos and thought it is nice if I share this post. While writing this post I remember my mother who used to prepare spices and chili powder at home. We didn’t like it at all because we all at home were sneezing.As I remember, my grandmother didn’t use chili powder at all. She always used the grinding stone to grind whole chili into a fine paste for daily cooking. I guess these are the secrets of grand ma’s cooking.In short, to prepare the red chili powder, what you need to do is , just grind dried chili. But before that you need to wash whole red chilies and dry under the sun.Dry red chili under sunlight-The Sri Lankan way of making Chili PowderHere is how to Make Chili Powder.Ingredients:Whole Red dried chili","Wash red chili and dry under the sunlight .Remove the stems of chili. In this step, you need to be careful as you may feel like burning. You can wear gloves.; Grind it to a fine powder. You can use a grinder. If you have a coffee grinder which is dedicated to spices and herbs, you can use it for grinding chili powder too.; Traditionally, in Sri Lanka it was mortar and pestle. Anyway nowadays there are places (grinding mills) where you can get it grinded if the quantity is large.; Once grinded, allow chili powder to cool completely and pack in an air tight container.; If you are unable to dry red chili under the sun properly or if you feel that chili is not properly dried, slightly toast chili in low flame. But remember not to burn.; You can also use oven.Lay red chili on a tray and bake for 5 minutes in 350F or until you still feel the smell of chili.; Do you use homemade chili powder? If so, how do you make your chili powder? Do you use a different method or recipe?

Just tilt the pan and mix sugar.If you use a spoon,sugar will recrystallize and will be sticky on the spoon.; Then pour this caramelized sugar into a pudding mould or cups.I used a 7cm diameter baking pan for the above quantity.After poured the caramel into pan,rotate the pan and allow the caramel to spread over the bottom of the pan.Keep aside to cool; Step 2:Make the custard fillingBefore making the custard,pour water into the pot of steamer.Allow to boil water till we prepare the mix.; In a bowl, lightly beat the eggs until combined.However make sure not to make foamy.; Add sugar andDissolve. then gradually add milk.Mix well. Strain through a strainer to make it smooth.; Now pour the egg mixture into the caramel coated mould.; Step 3:Steam the custard/caramel pudding; Place the pudding mix in the steamer.; Close with lid. Steam for  20 minutes.; After 20 minutes, press the pudding gently .The pudding is done when the top is firm when pressed.; Stop/switch off the heat. Allow another 5 minutes to steam with the remaining heat (after switching off); Step 4:Removing the pudding; I used a tooth pick and insert it through the edges and removed the pudding from the baking pan.Before serving, place a plate over the mould.hold firmly and turn over gently. The pudding will turn over onto the plate with caramel side up!; Now pour some of the remaining caramel over the pudding and serve it.; Ok,now you will ask me where is the poured caramel in my pudding! 🙂 I didn’t pour it.I made this in day time but wanted to taste when my husband is at home. So,I didn’t pour the caramel when I took photos as I didn’t want to make it difficult to wash the serving plate.But,you can do of course! 🙂; Without using a steamer,you can steam the Caramel Pudding in a pan.; You need a pan with a lid which is bigger than the pudding mould.Place a dish towel/piece of cloth in bottom of the pan. By this you can gently steam the Puddings.Cover the pudding mould using an aluminum foil. Then place the pudding mould on pan. Slowly add hot water to the pan just about a half-inch from the bottom of the pan. Cover with the lid. Then cook on low for 20-25 minutes.; I prepared another Sri Lankan pudding-Watalappanusing this method.Please have a look.; CarameldesertspuddingSri Lankan sweetsSweets","Blogging Tips, Food & Travel, Health & Fitness, Reviews, Desserts and Frozen",https://foodcnr.com/caramel-pudding-sri-lankan-style/,https://foodcnr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Sri-Lankan-dessert-Caramel-Pudding.jpg

Konda Kavum recipe from Aunty Gunawathie,,written byAmila Gamage Wickramarachchi,"November 11, 2013",,,,,,(about 45 Kavum)White Rice flour 750gAll purpose flour 150gSugar 800g Coconut oil for deep frying(use other cooking oil if coconut oil is not available)Few cardamom podsSalt as required(optional) Special Utensils/toolsA wok/thachchi for deep fryingA metal piece (this is an optional/ see the video for the shape of this piece)A wooden skewer,"First prepare Rice flour using white rice; Here is how to make rice flour for Sri Lankan traditional sweets.; Soak white rice in water for 2-3 hours. Do not soak more than 3 hours.; After 2-3 hours, drain water. Spread soaked rice on a paper or a plate and allow to dry fully.; Then grind it to a fine powder.; Sift rice flour using a sieve, so that fine powder is achieved. Grind whatever remaining and sieve it again. Repeat until all rice is ground into fine powder. You can prepare rice flour one day ahead before making Konda Kavum.; Make the Konda Kavum mixture; Mix rice flour and all purpose flour. Sieve it to a bowl. Keep aside.; Heat sugar with a little water until sugar is dissolved.Remove from heat Then add the flour mixture into it slowly until all the flour has been mixed into it.Add more water as required to make this batter.; Add salt as per taste. Mix well and prepare a batter which the consistency is similar to a pan cake batter.; Preparing the Konda Kavum; Once the batter is prepared, allow it to rest for 30 minutes.; Meantime, crush cardamom pods. Add this to konda kavum mixture and mix well.; To prepare konda kavum,; Pour oil into a wok/thachchi for deep frying kavum.; Heat oil.Check the metal piece in thachchi.Also see the notes below.; Then add a spoonful of batter (around ¼ cup) into the centre of wok. Let it cook. Halfway, use the wooden skewer and gently press the centre of kavum. At this time, the uncooked batter will come up. Using spoon/ladle pour hot oil over the batter. Same time turn and lift the skewer. Actually this is to shape the top part of Konda kavum. Pour oil continuously till the kavum is fried and golden brown.; Remove kavum onto a paper towel and allow to drain oil.; Continue the same procedure with the remaining batter.; Watch this video on how to cook Konda Kavum once the batter is prepared.Please ignore the quality of the video,I just recorded as it is easy to explain how to cook Konda Kavum; You can add batter directly to hot oil and shape it to a konda kavum. However this needs some skill.; I found aunty Gunawathie used a small metal piece inside the wok. Then she added batter into this metal piece and shaped the kavum. As per her, this is really easy to get the shape.; Anyway, how to find this type of metal mould/metal piece for cooking konda kavum? This is her tip. There are metal spoons in the market. Buy one and simply remove the handle. So simple, but makes it easier to cook konda kavum and still it looks very nice.Nicer and looks like a professional did.; Here is my tip:Why don’t you try a metal tart mould to replace this metal piece?If you can remove the handle from a spoon,it is fine.But if it is not easy,try a cupcake mould or tart mould.I am going to try this with a tart mould.Wait for my recipe with some more cooking tips on how to cook konda kavum.; Hope you enjoyed this post.Try konda kavum for this April New Year and let me know how it is….; Keep in touch,I am planning to share few Sri Lankan traditional sweets for this April New Year.Hope I will be able to share at least few more recipes!; See the above picture,it shows inside of Konda Kavum.These Kavum were so delicious and spongy.So I thought of sharing a photo of inside too.","Blogging Tips, Food & Travel, Health & Fitness, Reviews, Sweets",https://foodcnr.com/konda-kavum-recipe-from-aunty-gunawathie/,https://foodcnr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Avurudu-Recipes-Sri-Lanka.jpg

Banana flower fry (Kesel Muwa),"Banana flower fry (Kesel Muwa),banana flower stir fry or in Sri Lankan way, it is kesel muwa thel dala,Recipe for Sri Lankan Banana flower fry (Kesel Muwa),How to cut & clean a banana blossom,How to clean kesel muwa,",written byAmila Gamage Wickramarachchi,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,"for Sri Lankans to cook it as a stir fry or in a curry. Even we cook this as banana flower pickle or as a seeni sambal. I usually buy banana blossom (kesel muwa) whenever we visit Little India to buy vegetables. Among different Sri Lankan recipes to cook banana blossom, this is one of very easy recipe, which is called banana flower stir fry or in Sri Lankan way, it is kesel muwa thel dala.How to cut & clean a banana blossom?Before cooking a banana blossom, you need to cut it and clean. However, there are few tips that you should know to keep the fresh taste of banana flower in your dish. Although there are different ways to clean a banana blossom, here is how we do usually in Sri Lanka.At this time, I don’t have step by step photos to show how to clean a banana blossom, because whenever I do cleaning or preparing banana flower recipe, it is bit difficult to do the photographing at the same time. Doing quickly is important to avoid the bitter taste or dicolouring of banana blossom.So here are the few steps to clean a banana blossom.When you take a banana blossom, you’ll see there are lots of leaves covered tightly around the small blossoms. Outer leaves are usually maroon in colour. Also these maroon leaves are not delicious in a curry or in any recipe.So, remove the dark maroon leaves till you reach the inner soft light colour thing. With my experience in Sri Lankan cooking we discard the rough maroon leaves (matured leaves) till we reach the soft leaves. Then we start cutting/slicing. In this way, we use most of the banana blossom and discard few leaves (most of the time 3-4) depending on the quality of banana blossom. However I’ve found that in some cuisine such as Indian, Thai, they discard almost all maroon leaves till they reach the white part. So, that is up to you to decide until when you want to discard the maroon leaves.When you remove maroon leaves, you’ll find small yellowish blossoms. Don’t discard those blossoms; you can still add these blossoms into your recipe.  Once you removed all matured leaves, now it is time to cut/slice banana flower.In a bowl add some water and squeeze lime juice into it.Now slice your banana flower and add those into the water bowl with lemon juice. This is to avoid discolouring of banana blossom.  After slicing the entire banana blossoms and leaves, squeeze water and prepare it for cooking.To cook this banana flower stir fry recipe, add pinch of turmeric powder to the sliced banana flower and mix well. Keep it aside.Banana flower fry (Kesel Muwa)Here is the recipe for banana flower fry.Recipe for Sri Lankan Banana flower fry (Kesel Muwa)Ingredients1 small size banana flower  1 tomato cut in to slices 1 tsp chilly powder  1/2 tsp Curry powder  2 green chilly -cut into pieces  1/2 tsp turmeric powder  1 tsp mustard seeds  1 piece cinnamon  1 big onion chopped  Few curry leaves  Rampe/Pandan leaf 1-2 inch piece  2 tbs oil  Salt to taste  1 tsp Maldive fish (optional)½ cup thick coconut milk (optional)","Wash & cut banana flower in to small pieces and add to water with lime juice while cutting.After finish cutting,squeeze banana flower in water using hands & remove water.Then add ¼ tsp Tumeric powder and mix well.Keep aside.Heat the panAdd oil to itWhen oil is hot, add mustard seeds & when mustard seeds are popping up, add cinnamon & Mix wellThen add onion sliced.
