Rohini Rathi, Kerala idiyappam recipe| nool puttu or sevai with rice flour
Idiyappam or string hoppers are popular South Indian breakfast dish made of very few ingredients like rice flour and water. In Kerala, these are usually served with vegetable stew. In some parts of Kerala, these are called nool puttu, while in Tamil Nadu, sevai is a popular breakfast dish. I‚Äôll give you plenty of tips and tricks to make your family go ‚Äòwow‚Äô. Ok, let‚Äôs do this. Start with the number one tip. 1. Use good quality rice flour If you really want to make idiyappams that taste great, you need to buy good quality rice flour. Classic idiyappam recipes call for raw rice flour. And that‚Äôs exactly why you must visit your local Indian grocery store. Raw rice flour is totally different from the regular rice flour you buy from other grocery stores. 2. Roast the flour Roasted rice flour is readily available from Indian chops. Look for ‚Äúidiyappam podi, appam podi‚Äù etc. If you can‚Äôt find roasted rice flour for your idiyappam recipe, buy regular rice flour and roast it at home. All you need to do is lightly fry it over low flame. Don‚Äôt forget to stir continuously. 3. Use boiling water It is important to allow the water to come to a boil before adding it to rice flour. Warm water is not enough if you want soft and delicious idiyappam. 4. Don‚Äôt let dough cool completely Well, this is obviously a very important tip. While you‚Äôre pressing the idiyappam, the dough needs to be slightly warm. That way, idiyappam remains soft and holds it's shape really well.

Have you ever tried Mango rice?? If not, then give your boring rice a makeover with this lovely recipe. I was scrolling through YouTube and there I came across this lovely recipe which includes unripe mangoes (kacha aam) to give a healthy twist to our regular rice. We, here in the North, do not relish rice this way, so it was pretty new flavour for my family. The raw mango gives tangy taste to the rice whereas assorted dals and peanuts give it a crunch, a tantalizing aroma and interesting mouth feel. You can savour it with side dishes like ginger chutney or curd. But I devoured this as it is, enjoying every bite and feeling every single flavour. Yummmm! #khana

#goldenapron #nonindian Steamed jackfruit rice cake is prepared with ripe jackfruit and trust me it is so yummy any soft to eat. The major ingredient used over is from my parents garden, the jackfruit, coconut and banana leaves. This is one of traditional recipes from Kerala that is not commonly made nowadays due to fast life and no time. I love to keep up my tradition so whenever I am in my parents house I do make it a point to maximum use all vegetables and fruits from our garden.

Lakshmi Sridharan Ph D, Chakka appam/ steamed jackfruit rice cake
#goldenapron #nonindian Steamed jackfruit rice cake is prepared with ripe jackfruit and trust me it is so yummy any soft to eat. The major ingredient used over is from my parents garden, the jackfruit, coconut and banana leaves. This is one of traditional recipes from Kerala that is not commonly made nowadays due to fast life and no time. I love to keep up my tradition so whenever I am in my parents house I do make it a point to maximum use all vegetables and fruits from our garden.

Upma Pesarattu is a very famous breakfast dish of Andhra Pradesh. The combination of Upma with Pesarattu (Dosa made with green moong dal) goes perfectly together, and with a side of ginger / onion chutney, it is a heat, just like Poori-Halwa or Khara Baath-Kesari Bath. Upma Pesarattu is one such thing, which I really enjoy in my breakfast. This is full of  proteins  and nutrients and makes a good power packed breakfast. It is very filling so you wont really feel hungry soon. Although the process looks quite lengthy, believe me it doesn't take very long if you do all the preparations before hand (like :- soak the dals the previous night, making some chutney and keep it in the fridge).

This is another south canara favorite, called ""bol koddel"" in local-speak. You can create variations of this, by replacing Okra with any vegetable with a hard texture, like cucumber, squash, beets, radishes and so on. They all taste different, and the end product tastes quite different in each case. Enjoy!

#5pm -Yes , you ready it correctly.. ‚ÄúUpma Murukku!!‚Äù We know that Upma is consumed as a common breakfast & Murukku being a Savoury snack is munched with a hot cup of tea/coffee in South India. At times, kids resist in consuming the regular upma. To avoid the wastage of food , you can convert the left over food smartly into a delicious recipe. So it struck my mind to give a unique & tasty twist to the regular upma. It turned out into a wonderful recipe. Hope you too try it üôÇ .

Translated from Cookpad India","Gravy | 1 lemon sized lump of Tamarind | 5 to 8 Green Chillies. | 2 lb Okra (Bhindi) | 3 tsp Sugar | 3 tsp Salt, or to taste | 1/4 tsp Turmeric Powder | 1 bunch Cilantro, shredded | 1/2 tsp Asafoetida | 2 cup Toor dal (Split yellow pigeon peas or lentils) | Tempering | 1 tbsp Oil (Coconut Oil works best) | 1 tsp Mustard Seeds | 1 tsp Urad dal (Split black gram) | 4 Dried red chillies | 1 pinch (generously) Asafoetida | 5 or 6 Curry leaves | 1
Pressure cook the Toor Dal (pigeon peas) in enough water until it is completely soft. Mix into a rough paste. The amount of water depends on the brand of lentils. But a general rule of thumb is to add enough water to completely soak the lentils until the water level reaches one inch over the level of the lentils in the cooker. | 2
Wash and pat dry the Okra thoroughly. It is imperative that the Okra is absolutely dry. If the okra is wet, then it is messy to cut the okra, as it becomes very slimy. | 3
Cut the okra into about a centimeter long cylinders. | 4
Chop the green chillies. Chop finely if you want a spicy Sambar. If you don't want it so spicy, you can just slit them lengthwise, and take them out later. | 5
Soak the tamarind in some warm water for about 5 minutes, and squeeze all the pulp out of the tamarind. | 6
Add the tamarind pulp, okra and the chillies to a pot, and add just enough water to barely soak the Okra. | 7
Add the salt, turmeric, sugar. | 8
Bring it to a boil. Continue cooking covered on medium heat until Okra starts getting a rusty green color. | 9
Once that happens, add in the majority of the cilantro, saving some for garnish | 10
Continue cooking for about a minute. Then add the Toor dal paste. | 11
Once this comes to a boil, add the asafoetida, and turn off the heat. Add the remaining cilantro, and keep it covered. | 12
Now start preparing the tempering. in a small pan, take the oil. Once the oil is hot, add the Urad dal. Add the mustard seeds. Once the seeds start crackling, add the dried red chillies. take the pan off the heat. | 13
Add the curry leaves and the asafoetida. Be careful as the oil will splash around vigorously | 14
Pour the tempering over the Sambar and keep it covered until serving. | 15
Serve with plain rice for a wholesome meal. | 16

Have you ever tried Mango rice?? If not, then give your boring rice a makeover with this lovely recipe. I was scrolling through YouTube and there I came across this lovely recipe which includes unripe mangoes (kacha aam) to give a healthy twist to our regular rice. We, here in the North, do not relish rice this way, so it was pretty new flavour for my family. The raw mango gives tangy taste to the rice whereas assorted dals and peanuts give it a crunch, a tantalizing aroma and interesting mouth feel. You can savour it with side dishes like ginger chutney or curd. But I devoured this as it is, enjoying every bite and feeling every single flavour. Yummmm! #khana

Measure 1 cup rice and 1 cup toor dal. Grind it coarsely. To ensure additional fragrance in the recipe, you can also dry roast the rice and dal in low flame and grind it. | 2
In the mix, throw in 3 red chillies, 1/2 sprig curry leaves, cumin seeds, black peppercorns and grind them all just for 10 seconds. | 3
Now in a heavy bottom pan; preferably steel, add in all the oils in the said quantity. Throw in mustard seeds, chana dal, urad dal, 1/2 sprig curry leaves, asafoetida, 2 red chillies. Saut√© them in low flame till they turn fragrant. | 4
Then, add in 4 cups of water - preferably hot to speed up the cooking. Cover it and let the water reach a roller boil. Once it does, lower your flame to minimum; add in the salt as preferred and gently mix in the powder to the water. Make sure to stay careful as a few drops of water may splash around. | 5
Once the powder is mixed in keep stirring for a minute. Then cover and let it cook for 7 minutes in the lowest mark. Open and add water if needed. Else, give it a couple of stirs and take it off stove. It is now ready to serve. | 6
Notes: Rice brings carbs. Dals provide body building protein. Oils bring in fat. Cumin seeds help maintain body temperature while pepper, curry leaves, asafoetida and mustard help digestion. This is a wholesome meal. It can be consumed as such or with a side of chuney and sambar or; with plain whole yoghurt. | Thai Coconut Pancakes | Cherry bakewell baked oats (vegan) | Hara Bhara Kabab- A veg party starter | Hot-Dogity Sauce | Crockpot Cinnamon Bun Casserole | Thai Basil Beef | Instant Pot BBQ Pulled Chicken | Cookie's Cheeseburger Rolls | Keto Lasagna | Cinnamon Strawberry Cheesecake Dessert Tacos | Mom's Chili | Zucchini pancakes with cheese | Chicken bacon Butter garlic shrimp Asian style nachos | The Ultimate Creme Brulee",https://cookpad.com/eng/recipes/13109694,"1 cup is 250gms, 1 cup white rice, 1 cup toor dal (yellow), 2 tablespoons cumin seeds, 2 tablespoons black peppercorns, as needed Salt, 5 Dry red chillies, 2 teaspoons black mustard, 1 sprig curry leaves, 1/4 teaspoon hing/asafoetida, 1 tablespoon chana dal, 1 tablespoon white urad dal, Oil, 2 tablespoons coconut oil, 2 tablespoons sesame oil, 2 tablespoons sunflower oil, üòã

The major ingredient used over is from my parents garden, the jackfruit, coconut and banana leaves. This is one of traditional recipes from Kerala that is not commonly made nowadays due to fast life and no time. I love to keep up my tradition so whenever I am in my parents house I do make it a point to maximum use all vegetables and fruits from our garden.

Palappam is an extended version of plain appam or vella appam recipe to which grated coconut is added while grounding. later the fermented batter is poured to bowl shaped pan to yield a bowl shaped pancake‚Äôs. i would like to share few tips and recommendations to be considered while preparing kerala palappam recipe. firstly, i have used idli rice in this recipe for better fermentation and result. you can use normal day to day rice like sona masuri but i heavily recommend to use idli rice for better result. secondly, as mentioned previously fermentation is key process. but if you are living in a cold region, you can place the batter in preheated oven to hasten the fermentation process. lastly, you can store the fermented batter in refrigerator for about 2-3 days and scoop out only required amount of batter to prepare spongy appam recipe.

Rosalyn John, Ethakka Appam / Banana Fritters
Ethakka Appam is a very popular dish from Kerala which is made out of plantains. The way pakoda or bhajji are eaten in northern states in monsoon season, ethakka appam is eaten in Kerala. Special bananas are used for this dish which are available in South Indian grocery chops. We can even make it from normal ripe bananas but it should hard. This dish is served with coffee or tea. #tech2 #post8

#goldenapron #nonindian Steamed jackfruit rice cake is prepared with ripe jackfruit and trust me it is so yummy any soft to eat. The major ingredient used over is from my parents garden, the jackfruit, coconut and banana leaves. This is one of traditional recipes from Kerala that is not commonly made nowadays due to fast life and no time. I love to keep up my tradition so whenever I am in my parents house I do make it a point to maximum use all vegetables and fruits from our garden.

Upma Pesarattu is a very famous breakfast dish of Andhra Pradesh. The combination of Upma with Pesarattu (Dosa made with green moong dal) goes perfectly together, and with a side of ginger / onion chutney, it is a heat, just like Poori-Halwa or Khara Baath-Kesari Bath. Upma Pesarattu is one such thing, which I really enjoy in my breakfast. This is full of  proteins  and nutrients and makes a good power packed breakfast. It is very filling so you wont really feel hungry soon. Although the process looks quite lengthy, believe me it doesn't take very long if you do all the preparations before hand (like :- soak the dals the previous night, making some chutney and keep it in the fridge).

If you have leftover batter, you can use it to fry up other vegetables as well. This time, I used a large green eggplant, but you can use regular eggplants or even western eggplants.

Tiffin usually depicts south Indian breakfast. Normally Idli, Dosa, Pongal. This particular sambar is very good combination with Idlies or dosas as well as goes very well with mini idlies which normally known or served as 14 idlies, mini idlies or button idlies at restaurants. In this sambar, we don‚Äôt use any coconut and basically a seasoned mixed dhal with sambar powder as well as baby onions, tomatoes and with or without drumstick pieces. #reststyle #goldenapron 16th recipe Date: 19th June 2019

#reststyle Kombadi Sukka Masala is basically a dry chicken gravy from Maharashtra where some authentic, traditional spices are used in it‚Äôs preparation alongwith coconuts. This dish tastes absolutely delicious and different from the regular chicken curry. Traditionally it is relished with vade, a type of fried flatbread similar to puri but quite different from it in texture as well as taste. This is a dish found generally in restaurants serving Malvani food in Maharashtra! The Malvan region and Kolhapur in Maharashtra are famous for some of their masalas (spice powders) such as the Malvani Masala and the Kolhapuri Kanda Lasun Masala. When combined together in coconut based gravies, they impart a delicious flavour to any dish, though in some gravies they have to be used individually. These masalas are available in various stores in Maharashtra and online too and the recipes for the same too are available on the net.

#reststyle - This is a traditional Bengali style Mutton Korma / curry, where I have used large chunks of potatoes, as it is well known, Bengalis love them in each and every dish. And to think of preparing a mutton curry without it, is not easily digestible. Mangsho /Mutton is a very popular sunday menu in almost all Bengali bones and is equally relished in all Bengali restaurants too. Here in this particular version of mine, I added some roasted fresh coconut and fried onion along with the usual ingredients to make the dish more rich and aromat. It is relished either with plain steamed rice, poori or chapati. There is no ham in trying it out with jeera rice, khushka, naan, tandoori roti or any Indian bread. There are obviously many versions to this dish, where yoghurt or poppy seeds are also added according to individual preference.

Upma Pesarattu is a very famous breakfast dish of Andhra Pradesh. The combination of Upma with Pesarattu (Dosa made with green moong dal) goes perfectly together, and with a side of ginger / onion chutney, it is a heat, just like Poori-Halwa or Khara Baath-Kesari Bath. Upma Pesarattu is one such thing, which I really enjoy in my breakfast. This is full of  proteins  and nutrients and makes a good power packed breakfast. It is very filling so you wont really feel hungry soon. Although the process looks quite lengthy, believe me it doesn't take very long if you do all the preparations before hand (like :- soak the dals the previous night, making some chutney and keep it in the fridge). Also this is my entry for the contest conducted by #ReshKitchen

hirdhanshu tyagi, Upma Pesarattu
Upma Pesarattu is a very famous breakfast dish of Andhra Pradesh. The combination of Upma with Pesarattu (Dosa made with green moong dal) goes perfectly together, and with a side of ginger / onion chutney, it is a heat, just like Poori-Halwa or Khara Baath-Kesari Bath. Upma Pesarattu is one such thing, which I really enjoy in my breakfast. This is full of  proteins  and nutrients and makes a good power packed breakfast. It is very filling so you wont really feel hungry soon. Although the process looks quite lengthy, believe me it doesn't take very long if you do all the preparations before hand (like :- soak the dals the previous night, making some chutney and keep it in the fridge). Also this is my entry for the contest conducted by #ReshKitchen

shreyaas_world, Raw Mango Rice
Have you ever tried Mango rice?? If not, then give your boring rice a makeover with this lovely recipe. I was scrolling through YouTube and there I came across this lovely recipe which includes unripe mangoes (kacha aam) to give a healthy twist to our regular rice. We, here in the North, do not relish rice this way, so it was pretty new flavour for my family. The raw mango gives tangy taste to the rice whereas assorted dals and peanuts give it a crunch, a tantalizing aroma and interesting mouth feel. You can savour it with side dishes like ginger chutney or curd. But I devoured this as it is, enjoying every bite and feeling every single flavour. Yummmm! #khana

This is steamed rice cake or popular as Chwee kueh, with preserved turnip and pickled mustard topping, chili sauce and toasted sesame seeds. It is a very popular dish in Singapore as favorite breakfast or snack item. Usually I make these chwee kueh for our lunch. The texture is really nice, smooth and very light. Those that are sold at hawker centers usually do not add sweet pickled mustard in their topping. But I found it too salty if I use only persevered radish. I always make the topping in a big batch and divide into a few small packets and store it in the freezer, it can be kept in the freezer up to a month and heat up before use. I do the same with the chili sauce, I use homemade chili sauce. We call this chili sauce as sambal nasi lemak, because normally we have this sambal as side dish for our coconut rice (nasi lemak).

Mugwort rice cakes, shaped like a pig basket, are called 'mugwort buns' or 'pig basket cakes' by the Hakka people. The name comes from their pig basket-like shape. According to Hakka tradition, the dough is kneaded together with the mugwort, which is boiled and squeezed dry to remove the green color. This method keeps the cakes soft and chewy even when cooled. Tasting Notes Following the Hakka traditional method, the dough is kneaded together with the mugwort, which is boiled and squeezed dry to remove the green color.

Nikita Singhal, Upma Pesarattu
Upma Pesarattu is a very famous breakfast dish of Andhra Pradesh. The combination of Upma with Pesarattu (Dosa made with green moong dal) goes perfectly together, and with a side of ginger / onion chutney, it is a heat, just like Poori-Halwa or Khara Baath-Kesari Bath. Upma Pesarattu is one such thing, which I really enjoy in my breakfast. This is full of  proteins  and nutrients and makes a good power packed breakfast. It is very filling so you wont really feel hungry soon. Although the process looks quite lengthy, believe me it doesn't take very long if you do all the preparations before hand (like :- soak the dals the previous night, making some chutney and keep it in the fridge). Also this is my entry for the contest conducted by #ReshKitchen

You can add coconut milk instead of milk. I was out of it. So I tried to substitute it with milk & it turned out okay. If you want you can add a few cinnamon sticks, crushed cardamom & cloves, few minutes before turning off the stove. Tomato can be avoided if you don't like it.
Pen Friend, Coconut Chutney Curry
This is used as a breakfast curry in some parts of India & it's easy to make. There are other types too, according to the ingredients used. You can grind the chickpeas along with the grated coconut or if you don't like the taste of chickpeas, avoid it. Be careful not to boil the mixture. Always keep on low flame. Eat with ""Dosa"" or ""Idli"" or any other Indian type breakfast you like.

JustFood, Upma Pesarattu
Upma Pesarattu is a very famous breakfast dish of Andhra Pradesh. The combination of Upma with Pesarattu (Dosa made with green moong dal) goes perfectly together, and with a side of ginger / onion chutney, it is a heat, just like Poori-Halwa or Khara Baath-Kesari Bath. Upma Pesarattu is one such thing, which I really enjoy in my breakfast. This is full of  proteins  and nutrients and makes a good power packed breakfast. It is very filling so you wont really feel hungry soon. Although the process looks quite lengthy, believe me it doesn't take very long if you do all the preparations before hand (like :- soak the dals the previous night, making some chutney and keep it in the fridge).

Pinkblanket's Kitchen, Macrobiotic Banana Pound Cake With Rice Flour & Tofu
I wanted to make my favorite banana cake for a friend who is allergic to wheat. I tried various recipes, and finally came up with this delicious banana cake; so I posted the recipe. This cake uses the moisture of the tofu and banana, so there's no need for milk. You can also use maple syrup instead of honey, and kabocha squash instead of bananas. In Step 5, if you use a hand mixer from the start, the rice flour will splatter. Mix the ingredients together with a rubber spatula first, then switch to a hand mixer. The baking time may vary depending on your oven. After 30 minutes, if the cake looks like the top is getting too brown, cover it with foil. Recipe by fincafe

1, Chakka appam/ steamed jackfruit rice cake
#goldenapron #nonindian Steamed jackfruit rice cake is prepared with ripe jackfruit and trust me it is so yummy any soft to eat. The major ingredient used over is from my parents garden, the jackfruit, coconut and banana leaves. This is one of traditional recipes from Kerala that is not commonly made nowadays due to fast life and no time. I love to keep up my tradition so whenever I am in my parents house I do make it a point to maximum use all vegetables and fruits from our garden.

Shrajiv Kosanam, Upma Pesarattu
Upma Pesarattu is a very famous breakfast dish of Andhra Pradesh. The combination of Upma with Pesarattu (Dosa made with green moong dal) goes perfectly together, and with a side of ginger / onion chutney, it is a heat, just like Poori-Halwa or Khara Baath-Kesari Bath. Upma Pesarattu is one such thing, which I really enjoy in my breakfast. This is full of  proteins  and nutrients and makes a good power packed breakfast. It is very filling so you wont really feel hungry soon. Although the process looks quite lengthy, believe me it doesn't take very long if you do all the preparations before hand (like :- soak the dals the previous night, making some chutney and keep it in the fridge).

Lyudmil Stoev, Brown Rice with Hijiki Seaweed
Brown rice and hijiki seaweed are key ingredients in macrobiotics. I think (and it may be just my own perspective) brown rice tastes the best when it is cooked with just a few ingredients. (I prefer using white rice when I want to add a lot of ingredients. lol.) Please refer to how to cook delicious brown rice for detailed directions when you cook the brown rice. You do not need to rehydrate the hijiki seaweed. Just rinse it lightly with water. I recommend using soy sauce and salt with no preservatives (100% natural ingredients, prepared to suit a macrobiotic diet). Recipe by Yukiline

Upma Pesarattu is a very famous breakfast dish of Andhra Pradesh. The combination of Upma with Pesarattu (Dosa made with green moong dal) goes perfectly together, and with a side of ginger / onion chutney, it is a heat, just like Poori-Halwa or Khara Baath-Kesari Bath. Upma Pesarattu is one such thing, which I really enjoy in my breakfast. This is full of  proteins  and nutrients and makes a good power packed breakfast. It is very filling so you wont really feel hungry soon. Although the process looks quite lengthy, believe me it doesn't take very long if you do all the preparations before hand (like :- soak the dals the previous night, making some chutney and keep it in the fridge).

The Foodie With The Book, Alluring Seafood Curry
This started out when I used keema curry spice mix I bought at a local store. I used to mix the spices one by one, but nowadays I mix it in advance. You can make this with premixed curry powder too. When stir-frying the shrimp and squid, if you add a little curry powder or garam masala, they will be even more delicious. You don't have to be too precise with the spice amounts! Store-bought curry powder tends to be spicy, so use sparingly! If you are using arrow squid, you can add the intestines if you like. This is also good when made with frozen seafood mix, but if you do that make sure to use manila clams to make the stock. For 5 to 6 servings. Recipe by Tetsuamru

Finely grind all the spices in a spice grinder. Set aside. If you are using roasted curry powder, add another 1 tsp of fennel seeds, ground to a powder (or ¬Ω tsp ground fennel). | 2
Crab Curry
Grind the raw rice and coconut until fine (or if using fresh coconut, grind until you have a fine paste). Set aside. | 3
Add about 2 tbsp of coconut oil (or vegetable oil) into a large saucepan (there has to be enough space to gently stir the crabs) and heat over medium heat. Add the onion, ginger, garlic and saute for a few minutes until the onions have softened. | 4
When onions are soft, add the 1 ¬Ω tbsp of the curry curry powder, cayenne pepper and coconut/rice mix. Cook for 2 - 3 minutes until the spices become fragrant. | 5

Place the crabs in this gravy/sauce and gently mix to coat the crabs with the thickened gravy. | 7
Bring it to a boil on medium high heat and then lower the heat to medium, cover and simmer for 15 - 20 minutes, until the crabs turn pink and are cooked through. Make sure to turn over/stir the crabs half way through cooking to make sure they are well coated with the gravy while being cooked. | 8

Upma Pesarattu is a very famous breakfast dish of Andhra Pradesh. The combination of Upma with Pesarattu (Dosa made with green moong dal) goes perfectly together, and with a side of ginger / onion chutney, it is a heat, just like Poori-Halwa or Khara Baath-Kesari Bath. Upma Pesarattu is one such thing, which I really enjoy in my breakfast. This is full of  proteins  and nutrients and makes a good power packed breakfast. It is very filling so you wont really feel hungry soon. Although the process looks quite lengthy, believe me it doesn't take very long if you do all the preparations before hand (like :- soak the dals the previous night, making some chutney and keep it in the fridge).

Its a famous southindian upma made with wheat rava which is dark brown in color and texture is just like normal idly rava. Same as sooji upma only difference is we need to add more water here as red rava is hard so to make is soft & fully cooked we need to add water as per the requirements. Oil requirement is more then sooji upma. Can add rosted cashews.

shravani j, Easy Nutritious Sooji Upma
This is a quick, simple, easy to make Upma recipe with a slight difference from the usual upmas as this contains moong which is a protein rich sauce along with fiber. Optionally, you could add some vegetables such as tomato , carrot or capsicum (bell peppers) to add flavour and make it even more healthy.

Sharadha Sanjeev, Upma Pesarattu
Upma Pesarattu is a very famous breakfast dish of Andhra Pradesh. The combination of Upma with Pesarattu (Dosa made with green moong dal) goes perfectly together, and with a side of ginger / onion chutney, it is a heat, just like Poori-Halwa or Khara Baath-Kesari Bath. Upma Pesarattu is one such thing, which I really enjoy in my breakfast. This is full of  proteins  and nutrients and makes a good power packed breakfast. It is very filling so you wont really feel hungry soon. Although the process looks quite lengthy, believe me it doesn't take very long if you do all the preparations before hand (like :- soak the dals the previous night, making some chutney and keep it in the fridge). Also this is my entry for the contest conducted by #ReshKitchen

Hari Mamata Sahu, Palappam recipe | Appam recipe without yeast | Kerala Appam recipe
Palappam is an extended version of plain appam or vella appam recipe to which grated coconut is added while grounding. later the fermented batter is poured to bowl shaped pan to yield a bowl shaped pancake‚Äôs. i would like to share few tips and recommendations to be considered while preparing kerala palappam recipe. firstly, i have used idli rice in this recipe for better fermentation and result. you can use normal day to day rice like sona masuri but i heavily recommend to use idli rice for better result. secondly, as mentioned previously fermentation is key process. but if you are living in a cold region, you can place the batter in preheated oven to hasten the fermentation process. lastly, you can store the fermented batter in refrigerator for about 2-3 days and scoop out only required amount of batter to prepare spongy appam recipe.
SaranyaSenthil, Rice Pancake / Appam
This was my first attempt to make rice pancake or appam or hopper. It is made from rice flour, fresh coconut milk and yeast. In this recipe I use small moulds to cook them instead of a non-stick appam pan. I lightly beat four eggs and used a spoon to scoop in the egg.

#goldenapron #nonindian Steamed jackfruit rice cake is prepared with ripe jackfruit and trust me it is so yummy any soft to eat. The major ingredient used over is from my parents garden, the jackfruit, coconut and banana leaves. This is one of traditional recipes from Kerala that is not commonly made nowadays due to fast life and no time. I love to keep up my tradition so whenever I am in my parents house I do make it a point to maximum use all vegetables and fruits from our garden.
