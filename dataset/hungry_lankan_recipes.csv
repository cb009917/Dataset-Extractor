Chicken Dum Biryani (Pakki style),Fool-proof pakki style Hydrabadi Chicken Dum Biryani. Tender and juicy chicken layered with aromatic basmati and steamed to perfection.,There are a few cons and pros to both of these methods. The kacchi (raw) style definitely takes longer to make. You need at least 12hours of meat marination and then you need to cook it with steam for longer until the meat is cooked. But the hands-on time is very short since you cook it only once. And I can guarantee that you’re going to have melt-in-your-mouth tender meat at the end because of the longer marination in yogurt. The yogurt helps to breakdown the proteins and make the meat super moist and tender. Please refer to my,Beginner,,650gbone-in chicken (about 5 drumsticks); 3⁄4cupplain full fat yogurt(room temp if possible); 1cuponion thinly sliced (130g); 3green chilies; 1tbspghee; 1⁄2tbspcooking oil; 1tomato diced (125g); 1tbspginger garlic paste; 1tbspBiryani masala powder; 1tspKashmiri red chili powder; 1tspcayenne powder/red chili powder; 1⁄4tspturmeric powder; 1⁄3cupcilantro chopped; 1⁄4cupmint chopped; 1⁄2tsplime juice((optional)); 1⁄4cupwater; 11⁄2cupBasmati Rice; 1tspghee; 1⁄4tspcumin seeds; 3cardomom; 3cloves; 1cinnamon stick; 2bay leaf; 2.5lwater (approximately); salt (a lot)(refer notes above); 2tspghee; 2dropyellow food coloring or few safron strands; 1tbspmilk; 1⁄3cupgolden fried onion for layering and garnish; some cilantro leaves; some mint leaves,"Get a wide pot and add ghee and oil to heat up. Add your thinly sliced onion and fry them until they are brown, on medium heat. Mix time to time to ensure even frying. Do not wait until the onions burn which can make the curry bitter.; When onions are brown, add ginger garlic paste and mix well together. Lower the heat and cover if it splatters. Fry until the raw smell goes away.; Now add your diced tomatoes. Mix well together.; Cook the tomatoes until they're very mushy. Use the back of the spoon to mash them a little bit.; To that, add biryani masala powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, cayenne powder, turmeric powder, salt, and green chilies broken into big pieces.; Toast the spices with onions for about a minute in low heat.; Now add the chicken pieces and mix well together. Let the chicken pieces sear a bit.; Turn off the heat and add your yogurt. Make sure to beat the yogurt with a spoon to break the lumps and to make it smooth.; Mix well with the chicken, turn on the heat to medium-low and add 1/4 cup of water and mix.; Cover it and cook it until the oil separates from the curry. (While the chicken is cooking, you can also start washing and soaking the rice. Check the instructions on the next section); When the oil has separated in the curry, add cilantro, and mint leaves. Mix and cook for another few minutes.; After a few minutes, taste the gravy and see if it has enough salt. Adjust salt if needed.; Cover again and cook on medium-low heat until there's very little gravy left. (about 1/4 cup); When the curry is done, turn off the heat and add 1/2 tsp of lime juice and mix well. If the curry is already sour enough for you with the yogurt then you can skip adding lime.; Meanwhile, you make the chicken, wash your Basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Then soak the rice in water for about 15mins.; Heat about 2.5l of water in a large pot. To that add cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, ghee, and salt. Taste the water. It should taste pretty salty. Otherwise, your rice will end up bland. Let the water come to boil.; Add the rice and cook it until they're almost done (about 90%). To test that take a few rice grains out and taste. The rice grains have to be cooked all the way through but they have to be firm when you bite.; When the rice is 90% done, immediately drain the rice using a colander. Spread the rice in the colander so the steam can escape and it would slow down further cooking.; Now layer the rice on top of the chicken you made earlier. Do not press the rice with the spoon. The grains have to be nice and loose.; Mix milk and yellow food color in a small bowl. And pour the yellow milk around the layered rice. Also, add ghee, some of your fried onion, some of the cilantro, and mint leaves on the top of the rice.; Cover your pot tightly with an aluminum foil and close with a tight-fitting lid to stop steam from leaking.; Cook for about 4 mins on medium-high heat. Then set the flame/heat to the lowest setting and cook for another 15 mins. Turn off the heat and leave for another 15mins before you open it.; Serve without over mixing the rice with chicken.  Garnish with rest of the fried onion, cilantro, and mint. Serve with boiled eggs, yogurt or raita.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Non Vegetarian, Non VegetarianSpicy, Spicy, veganVeganVegetarian Meals",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/chicken-dum-biryani-pakki-style/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

The Best Sri Lankan Coconut Roti,This is the only recipe you need for the best Sri Lankan coconut roti. And possibly the easiest flatbread recipe you'd ever find in the world,"Yes, Once you knead the dough, make the balls and put it into the fringe, covered. It can last in the fridge for one to two days with no problem. Take them out and make the roti whenever you’re ready. The dough can also stay on the counter for 1 -2 hours depending on the room temp with no problem.",Beginner,,21⁄2cupfresh grated coconut; 21⁄2cupall purpose flour; 1.5tbspbutter; 2tbspthinly sliced shallot/onion; 1green chili(optional); 1sprig curry leaves (thinly sliced); water as needed (room temp); salt as needed,"Put the shredded coconut into a large bowl. Add softened butter, thinly sliced onion/shallot, green chili, sliced curry leaves, and salt. crush and mix well with your hands. Taste. It should taste a little salty. If not add a bit more salt and mix again. 
( The basic coconut roti only needs coconut, flour, water, and salt. You can skip all the other ingredients or use some but they add really good flavors); Add flour to the mix and carefully mix the flour with coconut mixture to coat all the coconut with flour. You can just run your fingers in a circular motion to mix them. no need to knead.; Then add water, a little by little and gently mix with your fingers to make big lumps.; When you enough water to foam some big lumps them knead the dough for about two minutes. No need to be vigorous like you make other bread varieties. You only need to make a pliable, nonsticky dough.  It doesn't have to be smooth.; Now divide the dough into 6 equal balls. If you want smaller Rotis divide the dough to 8 balls.; Using your two hands, make them into a round ball. One at a time. With this amount, you can make 6 balls. Keep them covered until you make them. (see the description for storing/freezing options); Now, on a clean flat surface, apply some coconut oil. You can a flat plate, a tray, a banana leaf, or even your clean countertop. Put one ball in, flat it out until you get about 3/4cm to 1cm thickness. Don't make it too thin, the Rotis would dry out and turn into a biscuity texture. If you roll them thick, then you might end up with a raw middle.; Heat a roti pan, or a cast-iron skillet (these are the best options but any other pan would also work). Lay a roti and cook about a minute or until you get nice char marks.; Then flip and cook again until it's cooked all the way through. When it's done transfer into a cooling rack. While one roti is cooking you can flat out the next roti.","Recipe Keys:veganVeganVegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non VegetarianSpicy, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/the-best-sri-lankan-coconut-roti/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg
Sri Lankan Egg Rolls,"These crispy, spicy Sri Lankan egg rolls are the best treat you'd ever find. Filled with a vegetable and tuna filling and half of an egg.",60 mins,Beginner,,"150gcanned tuna (5oz can) drained; 3cloves of garlic finely chopped; 1⁄4cupfinely chopped onion; 2green chilies finely sliced((skip if you don't like this spicy)); 1medium carrot finely diced; 2medium potatoes boiled and mashed into small chunks; 1⁄2cupleeks (green part only); 2tspchili flakes((skip or reduce if you don't like this spicy)); 1⁄2tspblack pepper; salt to your taste; 1tbspoil; 5eggs boiled, peeled and cut into halves; 240gall purpose flour; 1⁄2cupmilk; 11⁄2cupwater (may need about 2 tbsp of more water); 1⁄2tspsalt; 120gall purpose flour for the batter; 1cupwater for the batter; 1⁄4tspsalt for the batter; 1pack of traditional bread crumbs; oil for deep frying","Heat a tbsp of coconut oil. Add chopped garlic, chopped onion, green chilies and fry until onions get sweaty. Then add the diced carrot and some salt. Cook on medium until carrots are cooked all the way through. Then move the veggies to a side of the pan and add the chili flakes. mix and toast a bit and add the onion and carrot mixture. Add your potatoes. stir fry a bit and add the drained tuna. (You can use canned mackerel too but the taste and smell would be different.) Break with the spoon and stirfry for about a minute. Add the chopped leeks. Mix and well. If you feel like the mixture is too dry, add about a tsp of water and stir. Turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool down.; Whisk flour water and salt together and make a smooth somewhat thin batter (a little thinner than heavy whipping cream). You can use your blender too to mix the batter.; Heat a nonstick skillet or nonstick hopper pan (which is what I use). Brush a thin coating of oil using a paper tissue. Add about 1/3 cup of batter and swirl the pan to spread it evenly. Cook for about 30seconds to a minute or until it's cooked all the way through. (cover the pan if you use a nonstick hopper pan. If you feel like the pancakes are thick and not flexible, add a bit of water, a tbsp at a time, and thin it out. What you need is a very thin and flexible pancake.; Carefully transfer the pancake into a plate. Do not flip. Add 3 - 4 tbsp of filling in the middle. Also, place half of a boiled egg on the top. If you can roughly arrange the filling as a triangle, it would be easier in the next step.
(Meanwhile, you can make another pancake too. Then you can do this whole process like a production line); Fold from three corners to the middle to make it into a triangle. Check out the photo. Try not to leave much air inside the roll when you fold it. (why? read the tips on the recipe description); Dust a tray/plate with flour and place the roll. Do this whole process to all the rolls. Do not stack them.; add a cup of flour and a little less than a cup of water, and a bit of salt to a bowl and make another batter. If you have any leftover batter from the pancake making, you can use the same batter for coating too. Also, put breadcrumbs into a plate.; Now using tongs or one hand, dip one egg roll in the batter. And lift and hold it to remove any excess dripping batter. Transfer the eggroll to the breadcrumb plate, and coat well with breadcrumbs. Lift the roll and shake to remove any excess breadcrumbs and pat with your hand so that breadcrumbs stick to the pancake very well. Place it back on the tray/plate.
If the breadcrumbs you're using are very fine and powdery, do this coating process one more time to double coat the egg rolls.; Now if you have time, refrigerate the egg rolls in the fridge for about an hour or up until you're ready to fry them. If you're out of time, at least let them rest until the batter you use to coat dries out. As the batter dries out, the breadcrumbs stick to the pancake pretty nicely.; Heat oil in a deep vessel/pot. put a piece of a batter+breadcrumb piece and see if it floats immediately. If it floats then the oil is ready. Fry the egg rolls in hot oil. Make sure to flip them frequently to ensure even heat distribution. Also, be generous with the oil. Do not overcrowd the pan as the rolls drop the oil temp significantly. And add one roll at a time and let it fry for about 30 seconds before you add the next one. 
Put them on a paper towel after frying to remove excess water. Let them cool down on a cooling rack if you want to keep them crispy for longer.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Vegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/sri-lankan-egg-rolls/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Chicken Dum Biryani (Pakki style),Fool-proof pakki style Hydrabadi Chicken Dum Biryani. Tender and juicy chicken layered with aromatic basmati and steamed to perfection.,There are a few cons and pros to both of these methods. The kacchi (raw) style definitely takes longer to make. You need at least 12hours of meat marination and then you need to cook it with steam for longer until the meat is cooked. But the hands-on time is very short since you cook it only once. And I can guarantee that you’re going to have melt-in-your-mouth tender meat at the end because of the longer marination in yogurt. The yogurt helps to breakdown the proteins and make the meat super moist and tender.

Add your thinly sliced onion and fry them until they are brown, on medium heat. Mix time to time to ensure even frying. Do not wait until the onions burn which can make the curry bitter.; When onions are brown, add ginger garlic paste and mix well together. Lower the heat and cover if it splatters. Fry until the raw smell goes away.; Now add your diced tomatoes. Mix well together.; Cook the tomatoes until they're very mushy. Use the back of the spoon to mash them a little bit.; To that, add biryani masala powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, cayenne powder, turmeric powder, salt, and green chilies broken into big pieces.; Toast the spices with onions for about a minute in low heat.; Now add the chicken pieces and mix well together. Let the chicken pieces sear a bit.; Turn off the heat and add your yogurt. Make sure to beat the yogurt with a spoon to break the lumps and to make it smooth.; Mix well with the chicken, turn on the heat to medium-low and add 1/4 cup of water and mix.; Cover it and cook it until the oil separates from the curry. (While the chicken is cooking, you can also start washing and soaking the rice. Check the instructions on the next section); When the oil has separated in the curry, add cilantro, and mint leaves. Mix and cook for another few minutes.; After a few minutes, taste the gravy and see if it has enough salt. Adjust salt if needed.; Cover again and cook on medium-low heat until there's very little gravy left. (about 1/4 cup); When the curry is done, turn off the heat and add 1/2 tsp of lime juice and mix well. If the curry is already sour enough for you with the yogurt then you can skip adding lime.; Meanwhile, you make the chicken, wash your Basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Then soak the rice in water for about 15mins.; Heat about 2.5l of water in a large pot. To that add cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, ghee, and salt. Taste the water. It should taste pretty salty. Otherwise, your rice will end up bland. Let the water come to boil.; Add the rice and cook it until they're almost done (about 90%). To test that take a few rice grains out and taste. The rice grains have to be cooked all the way through but they have to be firm when you bite.; When the rice is 90% done, immediately drain the rice using a colander. Spread the rice in the colander so the steam can escape and it would slow down further cooking.; Now layer the rice on top of the chicken you made earlier. Do not press the rice with the spoon. The grains have to be nice and loose.; Mix milk and yellow food color in a small bowl. And pour the yellow milk around the layered rice. Also, add ghee, some of your fried onion, some of the cilantro, and mint leaves on the top of the rice.; Cover your pot tightly with an aluminum foil and close with a tight-fitting lid to stop steam from leaking.; Cook for about 4 mins on medium-high heat. Then set the flame/heat to the lowest setting and cook for another 15 mins. Turn off the heat and leave for another 15mins before you open it.; Serve without over mixing the rice with chicken.  Garnish with rest of the fried onion, cilantro, and mint.

The Best Sri Lankan Coconut Roti,This is the only recipe you need for the best Sri Lankan coconut roti. And possibly the easiest flatbread recipe you'd ever find in the world,"Yes, Once you knead the dough, make the balls and put it into the fringe, covered. It can last in the fridge for one to two days with no problem. Take them out and make the roti whenever you’re ready. The dough can also stay on the counter for 1 -2 hours depending on the room temp with no problem.",Beginner,,21⁄2cupfresh grated coconut; 21⁄2cupall purpose flour; 1.5tbspbutter; 2tbspthinly sliced shallot/onion; 1green chili(optional); 1sprig curry leaves (thinly sliced); water as needed (room temp); salt as needed,"Put the shredded coconut into a large bowl. Add softened butter, thinly sliced onion/shallot, green chili, sliced curry leaves, and salt. crush and mix well with your hands. Taste. It should taste a little salty. If not add a bit more salt and mix again. 
( The basic coconut roti only needs coconut, flour, water, and salt. You can skip all the other ingredients or use some but they add really good flavors); Add flour to the mix and carefully mix the flour with coconut mixture to coat all the coconut with flour. You can just run your fingers in a circular motion to mix them. no need to knead.; Then add water, a little by little and gently mix with your fingers to make big lumps.; When you enough water to foam some big lumps them knead the dough for about two minutes. No need to be vigorous like you make other bread varieties. You only need to make a pliable, nonsticky dough.  It doesn't have to be smooth.; Now divide the dough into 6 equal balls. If you want smaller Rotis divide the dough to 8 balls.; Using your two hands, make them into a round ball. One at a time. With this amount, you can make 6 balls. Keep them covered until you make them. (see the description for storing/freezing options); Now, on a clean flat surface, apply some coconut oil. You can a flat plate, a tray, a banana leaf, or even your clean countertop. Put one ball in, flat it out until you get about 3/4cm to 1cm thickness. Don't make it too thin, the Rotis would dry out and turn into a biscuity texture. If you roll them thick, then you might end up with a raw middle.; Heat a roti pan, or a cast-iron skillet (these are the best options but any other pan would also work). Lay a roti and cook about a minute or until you get nice char marks.; Then flip and cook again until it's cooked all the way through. When it's done transfer into a cooling rack. While one roti is cooking you can flat out the next roti.","Recipe Keys:veganVeganVegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non VegetarianSpicy, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/the-best-sri-lankan-coconut-roti/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg
Sri Lankan Egg Rolls,"These crispy, spicy Sri Lankan egg rolls are the best treat you'd ever find. Filled with a vegetable and tuna filling and half of an egg.",60 mins,Beginner,,"150gcanned tuna (5oz can) drained; 3cloves of garlic finely chopped; 1⁄4cupfinely chopped onion; 2green chilies finely sliced((skip if you don't like this spicy)); 1medium carrot finely diced; 2medium potatoes boiled and mashed into small chunks; 1⁄2cupleeks (green part only); 2tspchili flakes((skip or reduce if you don't like this spicy)); 1⁄2tspblack pepper; salt to your taste; 1tbspoil; 5eggs boiled, peeled and cut into halves; 240gall purpose flour; 1⁄2cupmilk; 11⁄2cupwater (may need about 2 tbsp of more water); 1⁄2tspsalt; 120gall purpose flour for the batter; 1cupwater for the batter; 1⁄4tspsalt for the batter; 1pack of traditional bread crumbs; oil for deep frying","Heat a tbsp of coconut oil. Add chopped garlic, chopped onion, green chilies and fry until onions get sweaty. Then add the diced carrot and some salt. Cook on medium until carrots are cooked all the way through. Then move the veggies to a side of the pan and add the chili flakes. mix and toast a bit and add the onion and carrot mixture. Add your potatoes. stir fry a bit and add the drained tuna. (You can use canned mackerel too but the taste and smell would be different.) Break with the spoon and stirfry for about a minute. Add the chopped leeks. Mix and well. If you feel like the mixture is too dry, add about a tsp of water and stir. Turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool down.; Whisk flour water and salt together and make a smooth somewhat thin batter (a little thinner than heavy whipping cream). You can use your blender too to mix the batter.; Heat a nonstick skillet or nonstick hopper pan (which is what I use). Brush a thin coating of oil using a paper tissue. Add about 1/3 cup of batter and swirl the pan to spread it evenly. Cook for about 30seconds to a minute or until it's cooked all the way through. (cover the pan if you use a nonstick hopper pan. If you feel like the pancakes are thick and not flexible, add a bit of water, a tbsp at a time, and thin it out. What you need is a very thin and flexible pancake.; Carefully transfer the pancake into a plate. Do not flip. Add 3 - 4 tbsp of filling in the middle. Also, place half of a boiled egg on the top. If you can roughly arrange the filling as a triangle, it would be easier in the next step.
(Meanwhile, you can make another pancake too. Then you can do this whole process like a production line); Fold from three corners to the middle to make it into a triangle. Check out the photo. Try not to leave much air inside the roll when you fold it. (why? read the tips on the recipe description); Dust a tray/plate with flour and place the roll. Do this whole process to all the rolls. Do not stack them.; add a cup of flour and a little less than a cup of water, and a bit of salt to a bowl and make another batter. If you have any leftover batter from the pancake making, you can use the same batter for coating too. Also, put breadcrumbs into a plate.; Now using tongs or one hand, dip one egg roll in the batter. And lift and hold it to remove any excess dripping batter. Transfer the eggroll to the breadcrumb plate, and coat well with breadcrumbs. Lift the roll and shake to remove any excess breadcrumbs and pat with your hand so that breadcrumbs stick to the pancake very well. Place it back on the tray/plate.
If the breadcrumbs you're using are very fine and powdery, do this coating process one more time to double coat the egg rolls.; Now if you have time, refrigerate the egg rolls in the fridge for about an hour or up until you're ready to fry them. If you're out of time, at least let them rest until the batter you use to coat dries out. As the batter dries out, the breadcrumbs stick to the pancake pretty nicely.; Heat oil in a deep vessel/pot. put a piece of a batter+breadcrumb piece and see if it floats immediately. If it floats then the oil is ready. Fry the egg rolls in hot oil. Make sure to flip them frequently to ensure even heat distribution. Also, be generous with the oil. Do not overcrowd the pan as the rolls drop the oil temp significantly. And add one roll at a time and let it fry for about 30 seconds before you add the next one. 
Put them on a paper towel after frying to remove excess water. Let them cool down on a cooling rack if you want to keep them crispy for longer.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Vegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/sri-lankan-egg-rolls/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Chicken Dum Biryani (Pakki style),Fool-proof pakki style Hydrabadi Chicken Dum Biryani. Tender and juicy chicken layered with aromatic basmati and steamed to perfection.,There are a few cons and pros to both of these methods. The kacchi (raw) style definitely takes longer to make. You need at least 12hours of meat marination and then you need to cook it with steam for longer until the meat is cooked. But the hands-on time is very short since you cook it only once. And I can guarantee that you’re going to have melt-in-your-mouth tender meat at the end because of the longer marination in yogurt. The yogurt helps to breakdown the proteins and make the meat super moist and tender.

Add your thinly sliced onion and fry them until they are brown, on medium heat. Mix time to time to ensure even frying. Do not wait until the onions burn which can make the curry bitter.; When onions are brown, add ginger garlic paste and mix well together. Lower the heat and cover if it splatters. Fry until the raw smell goes away.; Now add your diced tomatoes. Mix well together.; Cook the tomatoes until they're very mushy. Use the back of the spoon to mash them a little bit.; To that, add biryani masala powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, cayenne powder, turmeric powder, salt, and green chilies broken into big pieces.; Toast the spices with onions for about a minute in low heat.; Now add the chicken pieces and mix well together.

Then soak the rice in water for about 15mins.; Heat about 2.5l of water in a large pot. To that add cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, ghee, and salt. Taste the water. It should taste pretty salty. Otherwise, your rice will end up bland. Let the water come to boil.; Add the rice and cook it until they're almost done (about 90%). To test that take a few rice grains out and taste. The rice grains have to be cooked all the way through but they have to be firm when you bite.; When the rice is 90% done, immediately drain the rice using a colander. Spread the rice in the colander so the steam can escape and it would slow down further cooking.; Now layer the rice on top of the chicken you made earlier. Do not press the rice with the spoon. The grains have to be nice and loose.; Mix milk and yellow food color in a small bowl. And pour the yellow milk around the layered rice. Also, add ghee, some of your fried onion, some of the cilantro, and mint leaves on the top of the rice.; Cover your pot tightly with an aluminum foil and close with a tight-fitting lid to stop steam from leaking.; Cook for about 4 mins on medium-high heat. Then set the flame/heat to the lowest setting and cook for another 15 mins. Turn off the heat and leave for another 15mins before you open it.; Serve without over mixing the rice with chicken.

The Best Sri Lankan Coconut Roti,This is the only recipe you need for the best Sri Lankan coconut roti. And possibly the easiest flatbread recipe you'd ever find in the world,"Yes, Once you knead the dough, make the balls and put it into the fringe, covered. It can last in the fridge for one to two days with no problem. Take them out and make the roti whenever you’re ready. The dough can also stay on the counter for 1 -2 hours depending on the room temp with no problem.",Beginner,,21⁄2cupfresh grated coconut; 21⁄2cupall purpose flour; 1.5tbspbutter; 2tbspthinly sliced shallot/onion; 1green chili(optional); 1sprig curry leaves (thinly sliced); water as needed (room temp); salt as needed,"Put the shredded coconut into a large bowl. Add softened butter, thinly sliced onion/shallot, green chili, sliced curry leaves, and salt. crush and mix well with your hands. Taste. It should taste a little salty. If not add a bit more salt and mix again. 
( The basic coconut roti only needs coconut, flour, water, and salt. You can skip all the other ingredients or use some but they add really good flavors); Add flour to the mix and carefully mix the flour with coconut mixture to coat all the coconut with flour. You can just run your fingers in a circular motion to mix them. no need to knead.; Then add water, a little by little and gently mix with your fingers to make big lumps.; When you enough water to foam some big lumps them knead the dough for about two minutes. No need to be vigorous like you make other bread varieties. You only need to make a pliable, nonsticky dough.  It doesn't have to be smooth.; Now divide the dough into 6 equal balls. If you want smaller Rotis divide the dough to 8 balls.; Using your two hands, make them into a round ball. One at a time. With this amount, you can make 6 balls. Keep them covered until you make them. (see the description for storing/freezing options); Now, on a clean flat surface, apply some coconut oil. You can a flat plate, a tray, a banana leaf, or even your clean countertop. Put one ball in, flat it out until you get about 3/4cm to 1cm thickness. Don't make it too thin, the Rotis would dry out and turn into a biscuity texture. If you roll them thick, then you might end up with a raw middle.; Heat a roti pan, or a cast-iron skillet (these are the best options but any other pan would also work). Lay a roti and cook about a minute or until you get nice char marks.; Then flip and cook again until it's cooked all the way through. When it's done transfer into a cooling rack. While one roti is cooking you can flat out the next roti.","Recipe Keys:veganVeganVegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non VegetarianSpicy, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/the-best-sri-lankan-coconut-roti/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Add chopped garlic, chopped onion, green chilies and fry until onions get sweaty. Then add the diced carrot and some salt. Cook on medium until carrots are cooked all the way through. Then move the veggies to a side of the pan and add the chili flakes. mix and toast a bit and add the onion and carrot mixture. Add your potatoes. stir fry a bit and add the drained tuna. (You can use canned mackerel too but the taste and smell would be different.) Break with the spoon and stirfry for about a minute. Add the chopped leeks. Mix and well. If you feel like the mixture is too dry, add about a tsp of water and stir. Turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool down.; Whisk flour water and salt together and make a smooth somewhat thin batter (a little thinner than heavy whipping cream). You can use your blender too to mix the batter.; Heat a nonstick skillet or nonstick hopper pan (which is what I use). Brush a thin coating of oil using a paper tissue. Add about 1/3 cup of batter and swirl the pan to spread it evenly. Cook for about 30seconds to a minute or until it's cooked all the way through. (cover the pan if you use a nonstick hopper pan. If you feel like the pancakes are thick and not flexible, add a bit of water, a tbsp at a time, and thin it out. What you need is a very thin and flexible pancake.; Carefully transfer the pancake into a plate. Do not flip. Add 3 - 4 tbsp of filling in the middle. Also, place half of a boiled egg on the top. If you can roughly arrange the filling as a triangle, it would be easier in the next step.
(Meanwhile, you can make another pancake too. Then you can do this whole process like a production line); Fold from three corners to the middle to make it into a triangle. Check out the photo. Try not to leave much air inside the roll when you fold it. (why? read the tips on the recipe description); Dust a tray/plate with flour and place the roll. Do this whole process to all the rolls. Do not stack them.; add a cup of flour and a little less than a cup of water, and a bit of salt to a bowl and make another batter. If you have any leftover batter from the pancake making, you can use the same batter for coating too. Also, put breadcrumbs into a plate.; Now using tongs or one hand, dip one egg roll in the batter. And lift and hold it to remove any excess dripping batter. Transfer the eggroll to the breadcrumb plate, and coat well with breadcrumbs. Lift the roll and shake to remove any excess breadcrumbs and pat with your hand so that breadcrumbs stick to the pancake very well. Place it back on the tray/plate.
If the breadcrumbs you're using are very fine and powdery, do this coating process one more time to double coat the egg rolls.; Now if you have time, refrigerate the egg rolls in the fridge for about an hour or up until you're ready to fry them. If you're out of time, at least let them rest until the batter you use to coat dries out. As the batter dries out, the breadcrumbs stick to the pancake pretty nicely.; Heat oil in a deep vessel/pot. put a piece of a batter+breadcrumb piece and see if it floats immediately. If it floats then the oil is ready. Fry the egg rolls in hot oil. Make sure to flip them frequently to ensure even heat distribution. Also, be generous with the oil. Do not overcrowd the pan as the rolls drop the oil temp significantly. And add one roll at a time and let it fry for about 30 seconds before you add the next one.

Chicken Dum Biryani (Pakki style),Fool-proof pakki style Hydrabadi Chicken Dum Biryani. Tender and juicy chicken layered with aromatic basmati and steamed to perfection.,There are a few cons and pros to both of these methods. The kacchi (raw) style definitely takes longer to make. You need at least 12hours of meat marination and then you need to cook it with steam for longer until the meat is cooked. But the hands-on time is very short since you cook it only once. And I can guarantee that you’re going to have melt-in-your-mouth tender meat at the end because of the longer marination in yogurt. The yogurt helps to breakdown the proteins and make the meat super moist and tender.

Add your thinly sliced onion and fry them until they are brown, on medium heat. Mix time to time to ensure even frying. Do not wait until the onions burn which can make the curry bitter.; When onions are brown, add ginger garlic paste and mix well together. Lower the heat and cover if it splatters. Fry until the raw smell goes away.; Now add your diced tomatoes. Mix well together.; Cook the tomatoes until they're very mushy. Use the back of the spoon to mash them a little bit.; To that, add biryani masala powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, cayenne powder, turmeric powder, salt, and green chilies broken into big pieces.; Toast the spices with onions for about a minute in low heat.; Now add the chicken pieces and mix well together. Let the chicken pieces sear a bit.; Turn off the heat and add your yogurt. Make sure to beat the yogurt with a spoon to break the lumps and to make it smooth.; Mix well with the chicken, turn on the heat to medium-low and add 1/4 cup of water and mix.; Cover it and cook it until the oil separates from the curry. (While the chicken is cooking, you can also start washing and soaking the rice. Check the instructions on the next section); When the oil has separated in the curry, add cilantro, and mint leaves. Mix and cook for another few minutes.; After a few minutes, taste the gravy and see if it has enough salt. Adjust salt if needed.; Cover again and cook on medium-low heat until there's very little gravy left. (about 1/4 cup); When the curry is done, turn off the heat and add 1/2 tsp of lime juice and mix well. If the curry is already sour enough for you with the yogurt then you can skip adding lime.; Meanwhile, you make the chicken, wash your Basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Then soak the rice in water for about 15mins.; Heat about 2.5l of water in a large pot. To that add cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, ghee, and salt. Taste the water. It should taste pretty salty. Otherwise, your rice will end up bland. Let the water come to boil.; Add the rice and cook it until they're almost done (about 90%). To test that take a few rice grains out and taste. The rice grains have to be cooked all the way through but they have to be firm when you bite.; When the rice is 90% done, immediately drain the rice using a colander.

The Best Sri Lankan Coconut Roti,This is the only recipe you need for the best Sri Lankan coconut roti. And possibly the easiest flatbread recipe you'd ever find in the world,"Yes, Once you knead the dough, make the balls and put it into the fringe, covered.

If not add a bit more salt and mix again. 
( The basic coconut roti only needs coconut, flour, water, and salt. You can skip all the other ingredients or use some but they add really good flavors); Add flour to the mix and carefully mix the flour with coconut mixture to coat all the coconut with flour. You can just run your fingers in a circular motion to mix them. no need to knead.; Then add water, a little by little and gently mix with your fingers to make big lumps.; When you enough water to foam some big lumps them knead the dough for about two minutes. No need to be vigorous like you make other bread varieties. You only need to make a pliable, nonsticky dough.  It doesn't have to be smooth.; Now divide the dough into 6 equal balls. If you want smaller Rotis divide the dough to 8 balls.; Using your two hands, make them into a round ball. One at a time. With this amount, you can make 6 balls. Keep them covered until you make them. (see the description for storing/freezing options); Now, on a clean flat surface, apply some coconut oil. You can a flat plate, a tray, a banana leaf, or even your clean countertop. Put one ball in, flat it out until you get about 3/4cm to 1cm thickness. Don't make it too thin, the Rotis would dry out and turn into a biscuity texture. If you roll them thick, then you might end up with a raw middle.; Heat a roti pan, or a cast-iron skillet (these are the best options but any other pan would also work). Lay a roti and cook about a minute or until you get nice char marks.; Then flip and cook again until it's cooked all the way through. When it's done transfer into a cooling rack.

Add chopped garlic, chopped onion, green chilies and fry until onions get sweaty. Then add the diced carrot and some salt. Cook on medium until carrots are cooked all the way through. Then move the veggies to a side of the pan and add the chili flakes. mix and toast a bit and add the onion and carrot mixture. Add your potatoes. stir fry a bit and add the drained tuna. (You can use canned mackerel too but the taste and smell would be different.) Break with the spoon and stirfry for about a minute. Add the chopped leeks. Mix and well. If you feel like the mixture is too dry, add about a tsp of water and stir. Turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool down.; Whisk flour water and salt together and make a smooth somewhat thin batter (a little thinner than heavy whipping cream). You can use your blender too to mix the batter.; Heat a nonstick skillet or nonstick hopper pan (which is what I use). Brush a thin coating of oil using a paper tissue. Add about 1/3 cup of batter and swirl the pan to spread it evenly. Cook for about 30seconds to a minute or until it's cooked all the way through. (cover the pan if you use a nonstick hopper pan. If you feel like the pancakes are thick and not flexible, add a bit of water, a tbsp at a time, and thin it out. What you need is a very thin and flexible pancake.; Carefully transfer the pancake into a plate. Do not flip. Add 3 - 4 tbsp of filling in the middle. Also, place half of a boiled egg on the top. If you can roughly arrange the filling as a triangle, it would be easier in the next step.
(Meanwhile, you can make another pancake too. Then you can do this whole process like a production line); Fold from three corners to the middle to make it into a triangle. Check out the photo. Try not to leave much air inside the roll when you fold it. (why? read the tips on the recipe description); Dust a tray/plate with flour and place the roll. Do this whole process to all the rolls. Do not stack them.; add a cup of flour and a little less than a cup of water, and a bit of salt to a bowl and make another batter. If you have any leftover batter from the pancake making, you can use the same batter for coating too. Also, put breadcrumbs into a plate.; Now using tongs or one hand, dip one egg roll in the batter. And lift and hold it to remove any excess dripping batter. Transfer the eggroll to the breadcrumb plate, and coat well with breadcrumbs. Lift the roll and shake to remove any excess breadcrumbs and pat with your hand so that breadcrumbs stick to the pancake very well. Place it back on the tray/plate.
If the breadcrumbs you're using are very fine and powdery, do this coating process one more time to double coat the egg rolls.; Now if you have time, refrigerate the egg rolls in the fridge for about an hour or up until you're ready to fry them. If you're out of time, at least let them rest until the batter you use to coat dries out. As the batter dries out, the breadcrumbs stick to the pancake pretty nicely.; Heat oil in a deep vessel/pot. put a piece of a batter+breadcrumb piece and see if it floats immediately. If it floats then the oil is ready. Fry the egg rolls in hot oil. Make sure to flip them frequently to ensure even heat distribution. Also, be generous with the oil. Do not overcrowd the pan as the rolls drop the oil temp significantly. And add one roll at a time and let it fry for about 30 seconds before you add the next one. 
Put them on a paper towel after frying to remove excess water. Let them cool down on a cooling rack if you want to keep them crispy for longer.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Vegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/sri-lankan-egg-rolls/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Chicken Dum Biryani (Pakki style),Fool-proof pakki style Hydrabadi Chicken Dum Biryani. Tender and juicy chicken layered with aromatic basmati and steamed to perfection.,There are a few cons and pros to both of these methods. The kacchi (raw) style definitely takes longer to make. You need at least 12hours of meat marination and then you need to cook it with steam for longer until the meat is cooked. But the hands-on time is very short since you cook it only once. And I can guarantee that you’re going to have melt-in-your-mouth tender meat at the end because of the longer marination in yogurt. The yogurt helps to breakdown the proteins and make the meat super moist and tender. Please refer to my,Beginner,,650gbone-in chicken (about 5 drumsticks); 3⁄4cupplain full fat yogurt(room temp if possible); 1cuponion thinly sliced (130g); 3green chilies; 1tbspghee; 1⁄2tbspcooking oil; 1tomato diced (125g); 1tbspginger garlic paste; 1tbspBiryani masala powder; 1tspKashmiri red chili powder; 1tspcayenne powder/red chili powder; 1⁄4tspturmeric powder; 1⁄3cupcilantro chopped; 1⁄4cupmint chopped; 1⁄2tsplime juice((optional)); 1⁄4cupwater; 11⁄2cupBasmati Rice; 1tspghee; 1⁄4tspcumin seeds; 3cardomom; 3cloves; 1cinnamon stick; 2bay leaf; 2.5lwater (approximately); salt (a lot)(refer notes above); 2tspghee; 2dropyellow food coloring or few safron strands; 1tbspmilk; 1⁄3cupgolden fried onion for layering and garnish; some cilantro leaves; some mint leaves,"Get a wide pot and add ghee and oil to heat up. Add your thinly sliced onion and fry them until they are brown, on medium heat. Mix time to time to ensure even frying. Do not wait until the onions burn which can make the curry bitter.; When onions are brown, add ginger garlic paste and mix well together. Lower the heat and cover if it splatters. Fry until the raw smell goes away.; Now add your diced tomatoes. Mix well together.; Cook the tomatoes until they're very mushy. Use the back of the spoon to mash them a little bit.; To that, add biryani masala powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, cayenne powder, turmeric powder, salt, and green chilies broken into big pieces.; Toast the spices with onions for about a minute in low heat.; Now add the chicken pieces and mix well together. Let the chicken pieces sear a bit.; Turn off the heat and add your yogurt. Make sure to beat the yogurt with a spoon to break the lumps and to make it smooth.; Mix well with the chicken, turn on the heat to medium-low and add 1/4 cup of water and mix.; Cover it and cook it until the oil separates from the curry. (While the chicken is cooking, you can also start washing and soaking the rice. Check the instructions on the next section); When the oil has separated in the curry, add cilantro, and mint leaves. Mix and cook for another few minutes.; After a few minutes, taste the gravy and see if it has enough salt. Adjust salt if needed.; Cover again and cook on medium-low heat until there's very little gravy left. (about 1/4 cup); When the curry is done, turn off the heat and add 1/2 tsp of lime juice and mix well. If the curry is already sour enough for you with the yogurt then you can skip adding lime.; Meanwhile, you make the chicken, wash your Basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Then soak the rice in water for about 15mins.; Heat about 2.5l of water in a large pot. To that add cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, ghee, and salt. Taste the water. It should taste pretty salty. Otherwise, your rice will end up bland. Let the water come to boil.; Add the rice and cook it until they're almost done (about 90%). To test that take a few rice grains out and taste. The rice grains have to be cooked all the way through but they have to be firm when you bite.; When the rice is 90% done, immediately drain the rice using a colander. Spread the rice in the colander so the steam can escape and it would slow down further cooking.; Now layer the rice on top of the chicken you made earlier. Do not press the rice with the spoon. The grains have to be nice and loose.; Mix milk and yellow food color in a small bowl. And pour the yellow milk around the layered rice. Also, add ghee, some of your fried onion, some of the cilantro, and mint leaves on the top of the rice.; Cover your pot tightly with an aluminum foil and close with a tight-fitting lid to stop steam from leaking.; Cook for about 4 mins on medium-high heat. Then set the flame/heat to the lowest setting and cook for another 15 mins. Turn off the heat and leave for another 15mins before you open it.; Serve without over mixing the rice with chicken.  Garnish with rest of the fried onion, cilantro, and mint. Serve with boiled eggs, yogurt or raita.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Non Vegetarian, Non VegetarianSpicy, Spicy, veganVeganVegetarian Meals",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/chicken-dum-biryani-pakki-style/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

The Best Sri Lankan Coconut Roti,This is the only recipe you need for the best Sri Lankan coconut roti. And possibly the easiest flatbread recipe you'd ever find in the world,"Yes, Once you knead the dough, make the balls and put it into the fringe, covered. It can last in the fridge for one to two days with no problem. Take them out and make the roti whenever you’re ready. The dough can also stay on the counter for 1 -2 hours depending on the room temp with no problem.",Beginner,,21⁄2cupfresh grated coconut; 21⁄2cupall purpose flour; 1.5tbspbutter; 2tbspthinly sliced shallot/onion; 1green chili(optional); 1sprig curry leaves (thinly sliced); water as needed (room temp); salt as needed,"Put the shredded coconut into a large bowl. Add softened butter, thinly sliced onion/shallot, green chili, sliced curry leaves, and salt. crush and mix well with your hands. Taste. It should taste a little salty. If not add a bit more salt and mix again. 
( The basic coconut roti only needs coconut, flour, water, and salt. You can skip all the other ingredients or use some but they add really good flavors); Add flour to the mix and carefully mix the flour with coconut mixture to coat all the coconut with flour. You can just run your fingers in a circular motion to mix them. no need to knead.; Then add water, a little by little and gently mix with your fingers to make big lumps.; When you enough water to foam some big lumps them knead the dough for about two minutes. No need to be vigorous like you make other bread varieties. You only need to make a pliable, nonsticky dough.  It doesn't have to be smooth.; Now divide the dough into 6 equal balls. If you want smaller Rotis divide the dough to 8 balls.; Using your two hands, make them into a round ball. One at a time. With this amount, you can make 6 balls. Keep them covered until you make them. (see the description for storing/freezing options); Now, on a clean flat surface, apply some coconut oil. You can a flat plate, a tray, a banana leaf, or even your clean countertop. Put one ball in, flat it out until you get about 3/4cm to 1cm thickness. Don't make it too thin, the Rotis would dry out and turn into a biscuity texture. If you roll them thick, then you might end up with a raw middle.; Heat a roti pan, or a cast-iron skillet (these are the best options but any other pan would also work). Lay a roti and cook about a minute or until you get nice char marks.; Then flip and cook again until it's cooked all the way through. When it's done transfer into a cooling rack. While one roti is cooking you can flat out the next roti.","Recipe Keys:veganVeganVegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non VegetarianSpicy, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/the-best-sri-lankan-coconut-roti/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Add chopped garlic, chopped onion, green chilies and fry until onions get sweaty. Then add the diced carrot and some salt. Cook on medium until carrots are cooked all the way through. Then move the veggies to a side of the pan and add the chili flakes. mix and toast a bit and add the onion and carrot mixture. Add your potatoes. stir fry a bit and add the drained tuna. (You can use canned mackerel too but the taste and smell would be different.) Break with the spoon and stirfry for about a minute. Add the chopped leeks. Mix and well. If you feel like the mixture is too dry, add about a tsp of water and stir. Turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool down.; Whisk flour water and salt together and make a smooth somewhat thin batter (a little thinner than heavy whipping cream). You can use your blender too to mix the batter.; Heat a nonstick skillet or nonstick hopper pan (which is what I use). Brush a thin coating of oil using a paper tissue. Add about 1/3 cup of batter and swirl the pan to spread it evenly. Cook for about 30seconds to a minute or until it's cooked all the way through. (cover the pan if you use a nonstick hopper pan. If you feel like the pancakes are thick and not flexible, add a bit of water, a tbsp at a time, and thin it out. What you need is a very thin and flexible pancake.; Carefully transfer the pancake into a plate. Do not flip. Add 3 - 4 tbsp of filling in the middle. Also, place half of a boiled egg on the top. If you can roughly arrange the filling as a triangle, it would be easier in the next step.
(Meanwhile, you can make another pancake too. Then you can do this whole process like a production line); Fold from three corners to the middle to make it into a triangle. Check out the photo. Try not to leave much air inside the roll when you fold it. (why? read the tips on the recipe description); Dust a tray/plate with flour and place the roll. Do this whole process to all the rolls. Do not stack them.; add a cup of flour and a little less than a cup of water, and a bit of salt to a bowl and make another batter. If you have any leftover batter from the pancake making, you can use the same batter for coating too. Also, put breadcrumbs into a plate.; Now using tongs or one hand, dip one egg roll in the batter. And lift and hold it to remove any excess dripping batter. Transfer the eggroll to the breadcrumb plate, and coat well with breadcrumbs. Lift the roll and shake to remove any excess breadcrumbs and pat with your hand so that breadcrumbs stick to the pancake very well. Place it back on the tray/plate.
If the breadcrumbs you're using are very fine and powdery, do this coating process one more time to double coat the egg rolls.; Now if you have time, refrigerate the egg rolls in the fridge for about an hour or up until you're ready to fry them. If you're out of time, at least let them rest until the batter you use to coat dries out. As the batter dries out, the breadcrumbs stick to the pancake pretty nicely.; Heat oil in a deep vessel/pot. put a piece of a batter+breadcrumb piece and see if it floats immediately. If it floats then the oil is ready. Fry the egg rolls in hot oil. Make sure to flip them frequently to ensure even heat distribution. Also, be generous with the oil. Do not overcrowd the pan as the rolls drop the oil temp significantly. And add one roll at a time and let it fry for about 30 seconds before you add the next one. 
Put them on a paper towel after frying to remove excess water. Let them cool down on a cooling rack if you want to keep them crispy for longer.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Vegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/sri-lankan-egg-rolls/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Chicken Dum Biryani (Pakki style),Fool-proof pakki style Hydrabadi Chicken Dum Biryani. Tender and juicy chicken layered with aromatic basmati and steamed to perfection.,There are a few cons and pros to both of these methods. The kacchi (raw) style definitely takes longer to make. You need at least 12hours of meat marination and then you need to cook it with steam for longer until the meat is cooked. But the hands-on time is very short since you cook it only once. And I can guarantee that you’re going to have melt-in-your-mouth tender meat at the end because of the longer marination in yogurt. The yogurt helps to breakdown the proteins and make the meat super moist and tender.

Then soak the rice in water for about 15mins.; Heat about 2.5l of water in a large pot. To that add cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, ghee, and salt. Taste the water. It should taste pretty salty. Otherwise, your rice will end up bland. Let the water come to boil.; Add the rice and cook it until they're almost done (about 90%). To test that take a few rice grains out and taste. The rice grains have to be cooked all the way through but they have to be firm when you bite.; When the rice is 90% done, immediately drain the rice using a colander. Spread the rice in the colander so the steam can escape and it would slow down further cooking.; Now layer the rice on top of the chicken you made earlier. Do not press the rice with the spoon. The grains have to be nice and loose.; Mix milk and yellow food color in a small bowl. And pour the yellow milk around the layered rice. Also, add ghee, some of your fried onion, some of the cilantro, and mint leaves on the top of the rice.; Cover your pot tightly with an aluminum foil and close with a tight-fitting lid to stop steam from leaking.; Cook for about 4 mins on medium-high heat. Then set the flame/heat to the lowest setting and cook for another 15 mins. Turn off the heat and leave for another 15mins before you open it.; Serve without over mixing the rice with chicken.  Garnish with rest of the fried onion, cilantro, and mint. Serve with boiled eggs, yogurt or raita.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Non Vegetarian, Non VegetarianSpicy, Spicy, veganVeganVegetarian Meals",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/chicken-dum-biryani-pakki-style/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

The Best Sri Lankan Coconut Roti,This is the only recipe you need for the best Sri Lankan coconut roti. And possibly the easiest flatbread recipe you'd ever find in the world,"Yes, Once you knead the dough, make the balls and put it into the fringe, covered. It can last in the fridge for one to two days with no problem. Take them out and make the roti whenever you’re ready. The dough can also stay on the counter for 1 -2 hours depending on the room temp with no problem.",Beginner,,21⁄2cupfresh grated coconut; 21⁄2cupall purpose flour; 1.5tbspbutter; 2tbspthinly sliced shallot/onion; 1green chili(optional); 1sprig curry leaves (thinly sliced); water as needed (room temp); salt as needed,"Put the shredded coconut into a large bowl. Add softened butter, thinly sliced onion/shallot, green chili, sliced curry leaves, and salt. crush and mix well with your hands. Taste. It should taste a little salty. If not add a bit more salt and mix again. 
( The basic coconut roti only needs coconut, flour, water, and salt. You can skip all the other ingredients or use some but they add really good flavors); Add flour to the mix and carefully mix the flour with coconut mixture to coat all the coconut with flour. You can just run your fingers in a circular motion to mix them. no need to knead.; Then add water, a little by little and gently mix with your fingers to make big lumps.; When you enough water to foam some big lumps them knead the dough for about two minutes. No need to be vigorous like you make other bread varieties. You only need to make a pliable, nonsticky dough.  It doesn't have to be smooth.; Now divide the dough into 6 equal balls. If you want smaller Rotis divide the dough to 8 balls.; Using your two hands, make them into a round ball. One at a time. With this amount, you can make 6 balls. Keep them covered until you make them. (see the description for storing/freezing options); Now, on a clean flat surface, apply some coconut oil. You can a flat plate, a tray, a banana leaf, or even your clean countertop. Put one ball in, flat it out until you get about 3/4cm to 1cm thickness. Don't make it too thin, the Rotis would dry out and turn into a biscuity texture. If you roll them thick, then you might end up with a raw middle.; Heat a roti pan, or a cast-iron skillet (these are the best options but any other pan would also work). Lay a roti and cook about a minute or until you get nice char marks.; Then flip and cook again until it's cooked all the way through. When it's done transfer into a cooling rack. While one roti is cooking you can flat out the next roti.","Recipe Keys:veganVeganVegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non VegetarianSpicy, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/the-best-sri-lankan-coconut-roti/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg
Sri Lankan Egg Rolls,"These crispy, spicy Sri Lankan egg rolls are the best treat you'd ever find. Filled with a vegetable and tuna filling and half of an egg.",60 mins,Beginner,,"150gcanned tuna (5oz can) drained; 3cloves of garlic finely chopped; 1⁄4cupfinely chopped onion; 2green chilies finely sliced((skip if you don't like this spicy)); 1medium carrot finely diced; 2medium potatoes boiled and mashed into small chunks; 1⁄2cupleeks (green part only); 2tspchili flakes((skip or reduce if you don't like this spicy)); 1⁄2tspblack pepper; salt to your taste; 1tbspoil; 5eggs boiled, peeled and cut into halves; 240gall purpose flour; 1⁄2cupmilk; 11⁄2cupwater (may need about 2 tbsp of more water); 1⁄2tspsalt; 120gall purpose flour for the batter; 1cupwater for the batter; 1⁄4tspsalt for the batter; 1pack of traditional bread crumbs; oil for deep frying","Heat a tbsp of coconut oil. Add chopped garlic, chopped onion, green chilies and fry until onions get sweaty. Then add the diced carrot and some salt. Cook on medium until carrots are cooked all the way through. Then move the veggies to a side of the pan and add the chili flakes. mix and toast a bit and add the onion and carrot mixture. Add your potatoes. stir fry a bit and add the drained tuna. (You can use canned mackerel too but the taste and smell would be different.) Break with the spoon and stirfry for about a minute. Add the chopped leeks. Mix and well. If you feel like the mixture is too dry, add about a tsp of water and stir. Turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool down.; Whisk flour water and salt together and make a smooth somewhat thin batter (a little thinner than heavy whipping cream). You can use your blender too to mix the batter.; Heat a nonstick skillet or nonstick hopper pan (which is what I use). Brush a thin coating of oil using a paper tissue. Add about 1/3 cup of batter and swirl the pan to spread it evenly. Cook for about 30seconds to a minute or until it's cooked all the way through. (cover the pan if you use a nonstick hopper pan. If you feel like the pancakes are thick and not flexible, add a bit of water, a tbsp at a time, and thin it out. What you need is a very thin and flexible pancake.; Carefully transfer the pancake into a plate. Do not flip. Add 3 - 4 tbsp of filling in the middle. Also, place half of a boiled egg on the top. If you can roughly arrange the filling as a triangle, it would be easier in the next step.
(Meanwhile, you can make another pancake too. Then you can do this whole process like a production line); Fold from three corners to the middle to make it into a triangle. Check out the photo. Try not to leave much air inside the roll when you fold it. (why? read the tips on the recipe description); Dust a tray/plate with flour and place the roll. Do this whole process to all the rolls. Do not stack them.; add a cup of flour and a little less than a cup of water, and a bit of salt to a bowl and make another batter. If you have any leftover batter from the pancake making, you can use the same batter for coating too. Also, put breadcrumbs into a plate.; Now using tongs or one hand, dip one egg roll in the batter. And lift and hold it to remove any excess dripping batter. Transfer the eggroll to the breadcrumb plate, and coat well with breadcrumbs. Lift the roll and shake to remove any excess breadcrumbs and pat with your hand so that breadcrumbs stick to the pancake very well. Place it back on the tray/plate.
If the breadcrumbs you're using are very fine and powdery, do this coating process one more time to double coat the egg rolls.; Now if you have time, refrigerate the egg rolls in the fridge for about an hour or up until you're ready to fry them. If you're out of time, at least let them rest until the batter you use to coat dries out. As the batter dries out, the breadcrumbs stick to the pancake pretty nicely.; Heat oil in a deep vessel/pot. put a piece of a batter+breadcrumb piece and see if it floats immediately. If it floats then the oil is ready. Fry the egg rolls in hot oil. Make sure to flip them frequently to ensure even heat distribution. Also, be generous with the oil. Do not overcrowd the pan as the rolls drop the oil temp significantly. And add one roll at a time and let it fry for about 30 seconds before you add the next one. 
Put them on a paper towel after frying to remove excess water. Let them cool down on a cooling rack if you want to keep them crispy for longer.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Vegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/sri-lankan-egg-rolls/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Chicken Dum Biryani (Pakki style),Fool-proof pakki style Hydrabadi Chicken Dum Biryani. Tender and juicy chicken layered with aromatic basmati and steamed to perfection.,There are a few cons and pros to both of these methods. The kacchi (raw) style definitely takes longer to make. You need at least 12hours of meat marination and then you need to cook it with steam for longer until the meat is cooked. But the hands-on time is very short since you cook it only once. And I can guarantee that you’re going to have melt-in-your-mouth tender meat at the end because of the longer marination in yogurt. The yogurt helps to breakdown the proteins and make the meat super moist and tender. Please refer to my,Beginner,,650gbone-in chicken (about 5 drumsticks); 3⁄4cupplain full fat yogurt(room temp if possible); 1cuponion thinly sliced (130g); 3green chilies; 1tbspghee; 1⁄2tbspcooking oil; 1tomato diced (125g); 1tbspginger garlic paste; 1tbspBiryani masala powder; 1tspKashmiri red chili powder; 1tspcayenne powder/red chili powder; 1⁄4tspturmeric powder; 1⁄3cupcilantro chopped; 1⁄4cupmint chopped; 1⁄2tsplime juice((optional)); 1⁄4cupwater; 11⁄2cupBasmati Rice; 1tspghee; 1⁄4tspcumin seeds; 3cardomom; 3cloves; 1cinnamon stick; 2bay leaf; 2.5lwater (approximately); salt (a lot)(refer notes above); 2tspghee; 2dropyellow food coloring or few safron strands; 1tbspmilk; 1⁄3cupgolden fried onion for layering and garnish; some cilantro leaves; some mint leaves,"Get a wide pot and add ghee and oil to heat up. Add your thinly sliced onion and fry them until they are brown, on medium heat. Mix time to time to ensure even frying. Do not wait until the onions burn which can make the curry bitter.; When onions are brown, add ginger garlic paste and mix well together. Lower the heat and cover if it splatters. Fry until the raw smell goes away.; Now add your diced tomatoes. Mix well together.; Cook the tomatoes until they're very mushy. Use the back of the spoon to mash them a little bit.; To that, add biryani masala powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, cayenne powder, turmeric powder, salt, and green chilies broken into big pieces.; Toast the spices with onions for about a minute in low heat.; Now add the chicken pieces and mix well together. Let the chicken pieces sear a bit.; Turn off the heat and add your yogurt. Make sure to beat the yogurt with a spoon to break the lumps and to make it smooth.; Mix well with the chicken, turn on the heat to medium-low and add 1/4 cup of water and mix.; Cover it and cook it until the oil separates from the curry. (While the chicken is cooking, you can also start washing and soaking the rice. Check the instructions on the next section); When the oil has separated in the curry, add cilantro, and mint leaves. Mix and cook for another few minutes.; After a few minutes, taste the gravy and see if it has enough salt. Adjust salt if needed.; Cover again and cook on medium-low heat until there's very little gravy left. (about 1/4 cup); When the curry is done, turn off the heat and add 1/2 tsp of lime juice and mix well. If the curry is already sour enough for you with the yogurt then you can skip adding lime.; Meanwhile, you make the chicken, wash your Basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Then soak the rice in water for about 15mins.; Heat about 2.5l of water in a large pot. To that add cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, ghee, and salt. Taste the water. It should taste pretty salty. Otherwise, your rice will end up bland. Let the water come to boil.; Add the rice and cook it until they're almost done (about 90%). To test that take a few rice grains out and taste. The rice grains have to be cooked all the way through but they have to be firm when you bite.; When the rice is 90% done, immediately drain the rice using a colander. Spread the rice in the colander so the steam can escape and it would slow down further cooking.; Now layer the rice on top of the chicken you made earlier. Do not press the rice with the spoon. The grains have to be nice and loose.; Mix milk and yellow food color in a small bowl. And pour the yellow milk around the layered rice. Also, add ghee, some of your fried onion, some of the cilantro, and mint leaves on the top of the rice.; Cover your pot tightly with an aluminum foil and close with a tight-fitting lid to stop steam from leaking.; Cook for about 4 mins on medium-high heat. Then set the flame/heat to the lowest setting and cook for another 15 mins. Turn off the heat and leave for another 15mins before you open it.; Serve without over mixing the rice with chicken.  Garnish with rest of the fried onion, cilantro, and mint. Serve with boiled eggs, yogurt or raita.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Non Vegetarian, Non VegetarianSpicy, Spicy, veganVeganVegetarian Meals",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/chicken-dum-biryani-pakki-style/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

The Best Sri Lankan Coconut Roti,This is the only recipe you need for the best Sri Lankan coconut roti. And possibly the easiest flatbread recipe you'd ever find in the world,"Yes, Once you knead the dough, make the balls and put it into the fringe, covered. It can last in the fridge for one to two days with no problem. Take them out and make the roti whenever you’re ready. The dough can also stay on the counter for 1 -2 hours depending on the room temp with no problem.",Beginner,,21⁄2cupfresh grated coconut; 21⁄2cupall purpose flour; 1.5tbspbutter; 2tbspthinly sliced shallot/onion; 1green chili(optional); 1sprig curry leaves (thinly sliced); water as needed (room temp); salt as needed,"Put the shredded coconut into a large bowl. Add softened butter, thinly sliced onion/shallot, green chili, sliced curry leaves, and salt. crush and mix well with your hands. Taste. It should taste a little salty. If not add a bit more salt and mix again. 
( The basic coconut roti only needs coconut, flour, water, and salt. You can skip all the other ingredients or use some but they add really good flavors); Add flour to the mix and carefully mix the flour with coconut mixture to coat all the coconut with flour. You can just run your fingers in a circular motion to mix them. no need to knead.; Then add water, a little by little and gently mix with your fingers to make big lumps.; When you enough water to foam some big lumps them knead the dough for about two minutes. No need to be vigorous like you make other bread varieties. You only need to make a pliable, nonsticky dough.  It doesn't have to be smooth.; Now divide the dough into 6 equal balls. If you want smaller Rotis divide the dough to 8 balls.; Using your two hands, make them into a round ball. One at a time. With this amount, you can make 6 balls. Keep them covered until you make them. (see the description for storing/freezing options); Now, on a clean flat surface, apply some coconut oil. You can a flat plate, a tray, a banana leaf, or even your clean countertop. Put one ball in, flat it out until you get about 3/4cm to 1cm thickness. Don't make it too thin, the Rotis would dry out and turn into a biscuity texture. If you roll them thick, then you might end up with a raw middle.; Heat a roti pan, or a cast-iron skillet (these are the best options but any other pan would also work). Lay a roti and cook about a minute or until you get nice char marks.; Then flip and cook again until it's cooked all the way through. When it's done transfer into a cooling rack. While one roti is cooking you can flat out the next roti.","Recipe Keys:veganVeganVegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non VegetarianSpicy, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/the-best-sri-lankan-coconut-roti/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg
Sri Lankan Egg Rolls,"These crispy, spicy Sri Lankan egg rolls are the best treat you'd ever find. Filled with a vegetable and tuna filling and half of an egg.",60 mins,Beginner,,"150gcanned tuna (5oz can) drained; 3cloves of garlic finely chopped; 1⁄4cupfinely chopped onion; 2green chilies finely sliced((skip if you don't like this spicy)); 1medium carrot finely diced; 2medium potatoes boiled and mashed into small chunks; 1⁄2cupleeks (green part only); 2tspchili flakes((skip or reduce if you don't like this spicy)); 1⁄2tspblack pepper; salt to your taste; 1tbspoil; 5eggs boiled, peeled and cut into halves; 240gall purpose flour; 1⁄2cupmilk; 11⁄2cupwater (may need about 2 tbsp of more water); 1⁄2tspsalt; 120gall purpose flour for the batter; 1cupwater for the batter; 1⁄4tspsalt for the batter; 1pack of traditional bread crumbs; oil for deep frying","Heat a tbsp of coconut oil. Add chopped garlic, chopped onion, green chilies and fry until onions get sweaty. Then add the diced carrot and some salt. Cook on medium until carrots are cooked all the way through. Then move the veggies to a side of the pan and add the chili flakes. mix and toast a bit and add the onion and carrot mixture. Add your potatoes. stir fry a bit and add the drained tuna. (You can use canned mackerel too but the taste and smell would be different.) Break with the spoon and stirfry for about a minute. Add the chopped leeks. Mix and well. If you feel like the mixture is too dry, add about a tsp of water and stir. Turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool down.; Whisk flour water and salt together and make a smooth somewhat thin batter (a little thinner than heavy whipping cream). You can use your blender too to mix the batter.; Heat a nonstick skillet or nonstick hopper pan (which is what I use). Brush a thin coating of oil using a paper tissue. Add about 1/3 cup of batter and swirl the pan to spread it evenly. Cook for about 30seconds to a minute or until it's cooked all the way through. (cover the pan if you use a nonstick hopper pan. If you feel like the pancakes are thick and not flexible, add a bit of water, a tbsp at a time, and thin it out. What you need is a very thin and flexible pancake.; Carefully transfer the pancake into a plate. Do not flip. Add 3 - 4 tbsp of filling in the middle. Also, place half of a boiled egg on the top. If you can roughly arrange the filling as a triangle, it would be easier in the next step.
(Meanwhile, you can make another pancake too. Then you can do this whole process like a production line); Fold from three corners to the middle to make it into a triangle. Check out the photo. Try not to leave much air inside the roll when you fold it. (why? read the tips on the recipe description); Dust a tray/plate with flour and place the roll. Do this whole process to all the rolls. Do not stack them.; add a cup of flour and a little less than a cup of water, and a bit of salt to a bowl and make another batter. If you have any leftover batter from the pancake making, you can use the same batter for coating too. Also, put breadcrumbs into a plate.; Now using tongs or one hand, dip one egg roll in the batter. And lift and hold it to remove any excess dripping batter. Transfer the eggroll to the breadcrumb plate, and coat well with breadcrumbs. Lift the roll and shake to remove any excess breadcrumbs and pat with your hand so that breadcrumbs stick to the pancake very well. Place it back on the tray/plate.
If the breadcrumbs you're using are very fine and powdery, do this coating process one more time to double coat the egg rolls.; Now if you have time, refrigerate the egg rolls in the fridge for about an hour or up until you're ready to fry them. If you're out of time, at least let them rest until the batter you use to coat dries out. As the batter dries out, the breadcrumbs stick to the pancake pretty nicely.; Heat oil in a deep vessel/pot. put a piece of a batter+breadcrumb piece and see if it floats immediately. If it floats then the oil is ready. Fry the egg rolls in hot oil. Make sure to flip them frequently to ensure even heat distribution. Also, be generous with the oil. Do not overcrowd the pan as the rolls drop the oil temp significantly. And add one roll at a time and let it fry for about 30 seconds before you add the next one. 
Put them on a paper towel after frying to remove excess water. Let them cool down on a cooling rack if you want to keep them crispy for longer.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Vegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/sri-lankan-egg-rolls/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Chicken Dum Biryani (Pakki style),Fool-proof pakki style Hydrabadi Chicken Dum Biryani. Tender and juicy chicken layered with aromatic basmati and steamed to perfection.,There are a few cons and pros to both of these methods. The kacchi (raw) style definitely takes longer to make. You need at least 12hours of meat marination and then you need to cook it with steam for longer until the meat is cooked. But the hands-on time is very short since you cook it only once. And I can guarantee that you’re going to have melt-in-your-mouth tender meat at the end because of the longer marination in yogurt. The yogurt helps to breakdown the proteins and make the meat super moist and tender. Please refer to my,Beginner,,650gbone-in chicken (about 5 drumsticks); 3⁄4cupplain full fat yogurt(room temp if possible); 1cuponion thinly sliced (130g); 3green chilies; 1tbspghee; 1⁄2tbspcooking oil; 1tomato diced (125g); 1tbspginger garlic paste; 1tbspBiryani masala powder; 1tspKashmiri red chili powder; 1tspcayenne powder/red chili powder; 1⁄4tspturmeric powder; 1⁄3cupcilantro chopped; 1⁄4cupmint chopped; 1⁄2tsplime juice((optional)); 1⁄4cupwater; 11⁄2cupBasmati Rice; 1tspghee; 1⁄4tspcumin seeds; 3cardomom; 3cloves; 1cinnamon stick; 2bay leaf; 2.5lwater (approximately); salt (a lot)(refer notes above); 2tspghee; 2dropyellow food coloring or few safron strands; 1tbspmilk; 1⁄3cupgolden fried onion for layering and garnish; some cilantro leaves; some mint leaves,"Get a wide pot and add ghee and oil to heat up. Add your thinly sliced onion and fry them until they are brown, on medium heat. Mix time to time to ensure even frying. Do not wait until the onions burn which can make the curry bitter.; When onions are brown, add ginger garlic paste and mix well together. Lower the heat and cover if it splatters. Fry until the raw smell goes away.; Now add your diced tomatoes. Mix well together.; Cook the tomatoes until they're very mushy. Use the back of the spoon to mash them a little bit.; To that, add biryani masala powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, cayenne powder, turmeric powder, salt, and green chilies broken into big pieces.; Toast the spices with onions for about a minute in low heat.; Now add the chicken pieces and mix well together. Let the chicken pieces sear a bit.; Turn off the heat and add your yogurt. Make sure to beat the yogurt with a spoon to break the lumps and to make it smooth.; Mix well with the chicken, turn on the heat to medium-low and add 1/4 cup of water and mix.; Cover it and cook it until the oil separates from the curry. (While the chicken is cooking, you can also start washing and soaking the rice. Check the instructions on the next section); When the oil has separated in the curry, add cilantro, and mint leaves. Mix and cook for another few minutes.; After a few minutes, taste the gravy and see if it has enough salt. Adjust salt if needed.; Cover again and cook on medium-low heat until there's very little gravy left. (about 1/4 cup); When the curry is done, turn off the heat and add 1/2 tsp of lime juice and mix well. If the curry is already sour enough for you with the yogurt then you can skip adding lime.; Meanwhile, you make the chicken, wash your Basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Then soak the rice in water for about 15mins.; Heat about 2.5l of water in a large pot. To that add cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, ghee, and salt. Taste the water. It should taste pretty salty. Otherwise, your rice will end up bland. Let the water come to boil.; Add the rice and cook it until they're almost done (about 90%). To test that take a few rice grains out and taste. The rice grains have to be cooked all the way through but they have to be firm when you bite.; When the rice is 90% done, immediately drain the rice using a colander. Spread the rice in the colander so the steam can escape and it would slow down further cooking.; Now layer the rice on top of the chicken you made earlier. Do not press the rice with the spoon. The grains have to be nice and loose.; Mix milk and yellow food color in a small bowl. And pour the yellow milk around the layered rice. Also, add ghee, some of your fried onion, some of the cilantro, and mint leaves on the top of the rice.; Cover your pot tightly with an aluminum foil and close with a tight-fitting lid to stop steam from leaking.; Cook for about 4 mins on medium-high heat. Then set the flame/heat to the lowest setting and cook for another 15 mins. Turn off the heat and leave for another 15mins before you open it.; Serve without over mixing the rice with chicken.  Garnish with rest of the fried onion, cilantro, and mint. Serve with boiled eggs, yogurt or raita.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Non Vegetarian, Non VegetarianSpicy, Spicy, veganVeganVegetarian Meals",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/chicken-dum-biryani-pakki-style/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

If you feel like the pancakes are thick and not flexible, add a bit of water, a tbsp at a time, and thin it out. What you need is a very thin and flexible pancake.; Carefully transfer the pancake into a plate. Do not flip. Add 3 - 4 tbsp of filling in the middle. Also, place half of a boiled egg on the top. If you can roughly arrange the filling as a triangle, it would be easier in the next step.

And lift and hold it to remove any excess dripping batter. Transfer the eggroll to the breadcrumb plate, and coat well with breadcrumbs. Lift the roll and shake to remove any excess breadcrumbs and pat with your hand so that breadcrumbs stick to the pancake very well. Place it back on the tray/plate.
If the breadcrumbs you're using are very fine and powdery, do this coating process one more time to double coat the egg rolls.; Now if you have time, refrigerate the egg rolls in the fridge for about an hour or up until you're ready to fry them. If you're out of time, at least let them rest until the batter you use to coat dries out.

Wash it thoroughly to remove any mud or impurities. And peel or scrape the skin off. Then cut the lotus roots into very thin slices. Probably about 1mm to 2mm thin. If you cut them thinner they would cook a lot quicker. Wash the slices to remove excess starch.; Now add all the lotus root slices to a bowl and add some water. Mix about a tsp of salt and a tsp vinegar to the mix. This would help to remove some of the germs. (optional step, you can skip if you want); Heat 2 tsp oil in a pot. Add mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds.; When the mustard seeds start to splatter, add curry leaves, dried red chilies (broken and seeds removed). Mix for few seconds until chilies start to brown a little bit.; Now add chopped onion, garlic, piece of garcinia cambogia (goraka) and let it cook until the onions start to sweat.; For that, add curry powder, chili powder (you can skip or reduce the amount of chili powder you add according to your likings.) and turmeric powder and salt to your taste. roast the spices in oil, continuously mixing.; Now add the lotus root slices (without the salt-vinegar water) and mix well with the spice mixture.; When everything is nicely mixed together, add very thin coconut milk or water to cover all the lotus root slices. Put the lid on and cook until lotus root slices are tender. ( You might need more or less than one cup.)
If you use canned coconut milk, mix about 1 1/2 tbsp with water to make thin coconut milk. If you use freshly squeezed coconut milk, then use the third or fourth squeeze.; Halfway through the cooking, taste the broth and see if it's sour and salty enough. You can remove the Garcinia/Goraka piece at this moment if you can already taste enough sourness from the curry. Don't wait too long since you only need to add a hint of sourness. Also, adjust salt if needed.
Cover again and cook, until you get a little to 1/4 cup of broth left or until the lotus root slices are tender. If the pieces aren't tender yet, you can add some water and cook a bit more longer. (Keep in mind that lotus roots always have some bite to them so you cannot get them super soft.); Finally, add thick coconut milk and cook on medium-low heat until you get the desired consistency. Stir few times.","Recipe Keys:veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non Vegetarian, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/vegan-lotus-root-curry/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Vegetarian Spicy potato curry buns,A foolproof recipe to make supersoft and spicy vegetarian potato curry buns. These buns are perfect for a savory brekfast or as an evening snack.,"Do not rely on time when you let the dough rise. Focus on the size of the dough. The time it takes for the dough to double in size varies with many factors like temperature, yeast activity, sugar content, etc. With this recipe, it can take approximately 45mins – 75mins.",Beginner,,"250gboiled and roughly mashed potatoes; 3⁄4cupLeek (green part thinly sliced); 1⁄2flozonion chopped; 3green chilies finely chopped(adjust to your likings); 1spring curry leaves, finely chopped; 1tspchili powder/paprika; 1tspchili flakes; 1⁄4tspturmeric; 1⁄3tspmustard seeds; 1⁄3tspcumin seeds; 1tbspcoconut oil; salt to your taste; 300gbread flour; 170gmilk; 20gbutter; 15gsugar; 5ginstant dry yeast; 6gsalt; 1egg yolk; 1tbspmilk","Heat 1 tbsp of coconut oil in a nonstick pan. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds.; When the mustard seeds start to splatter, add finely chopped curry leaves, finely chopped onions, thinly sliced green chilies, and salt.  Mix well and let it cook until the onions get sweaty.; Lower the heat. Add chili powder, chili flakes, and turmeric powder. Mix well. This filling is quite hot so reduce the amount of chilies if you cannot handle the heat.; Add the roughly mashed potatoes. Mix well until everything combines together.; Add your sliced leeks. Mix on high heat. Do a taste test. Sprinkle and mix salt if needed. Turn off the heat.; Change it to another dish and let it cool down before you use it in the filing.; Warm your milk just a little bit. you should be able to dip your finger comfortably in the milk.  Too hot, you can kill your yeast. Add the milk mixture to the mixer bowl. Add sugar and sprinkle instant dry yeast on to the surface of the milk. mix a little bit. If you're 100% sure your instant dry yeast is new and good, you can skip this test and mix all the dough ingredients together. If you use active dry yeast, then definitely activate it using warm milk as I have mentioned above, before you mix the dough.
Let the mixture sit there for 2- 5 mins. You should be able to see the pieces of yeast mix float on the milk. And also tiny frothy pieces that have tiny bubbles.; Now add softened (almost melted) butter, salt, and flour.; Knead the dough in the mixer for about 10 mins until the dough is smooth and stretchy.  If the dough seems dry and hard, and a tiny bit of water, about a tsp at a time. (Some flour brands absorb more water than others)
The dough has to be nonstick, smooth, stretchy, and pliable. 

If you hand knead this, knead about 20mins or until you get a cohesive, nonstick smooth and stretchy dough.; Take the dough out from the mixer bowl, knead for a minute and shape it to a ball. lightly grease a bowl with some butter. Place the dough, seam-side down. Cover with a plastic wrap; Let the dough rise until it's doubled in size.; When the dough has doubled in size, remove the plastic wrap, and punch it down to remove the air.; Take the dough out to the counter. Divide the dough into 8 equal size portions.; Now take one piece at a time, shape it to a ball, and put it on the counter, seam side down, and cover with a plastic wrap.; Do this to all the dough pieces. Keep all the dough balls covered all the time. Always arrange the balls in order. Now take the first ball out.; Flip the dough ball. So the smooth side of the dough ball goes down and the seam side is up. flat it out to make a disk that is about 4 inches in diameter.; Put the filling in. Take the edges of the disk to the middle. And pinch those ends together tightly so they won't open up in the oven.; Flip the filled dough, so the seams are down again and the smooth side is up. Gently shape it to a round perfect ball.; Put it on the baking sheet and cover with a plastic wrap. Repeat this process with all the balls.; Let the filled dough balls rise again about 50% - 75% of their size. This won't take time as much as it took for the first rise. For me, it usually takes about 30mins. This could be vary depending on the temperature of your house. Do not let them rise too much, they will collapse in the oven and you'll get wrinkles on the top, and buns would be dry.  IF they haven't risen enough, then the buns would be dense and tough.; Also, turn on the oven to preheat to 400F.; Make an egg -wash by mixing 1 egg yolk and 1 tbsp of milk together. If you want to keep this vegetarian, you can use melted butter or milk for this. Now coat the buns with the egg wash using a brush. Coat twice if you like the buns a little darker.; Sprinkle with sesame seeds. (optional) Bake in a preheated oven. 400F temp for approximately 12 mins. Let them cool down for at least 30mins before you serve them.","Recipe Keys:Vegetarian Meals, Non Vegetarian, Spicy, veganVeganVegetarian Meals",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/vegetarian-spicy-potato-curry-buns/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

You might need to add or reduce the amount of water you have to add to get the right consistency.; Cut the tuna pieces into somewhat thin and flat pieces. I like my fish pieces a bit smaller, so mine are about 3 inches wide and 1 inch thick.; Now apply a thin coating of oil to your clay pot. (if you don't have a clay pot use any other heavy bottom skillet that takes longer to cool down). This makes sure that pieces aren't going to stick to the pot. And also it roasts the fish pieces a little bit, which adds a nice roasted flavor.; Then dip one piece into the Ambul Thiyal batter and cover it very well with the Ambul Thiyal paste. Now place it in the clay pot. wider side down.; Do the same with all the pieces, one at a time and, arrange then into one layer. Every fish piece has to touch the bottom. If one pan is not enough to arrange all the pieces, then use another pan. Do not stack the fish pieces. For 1.5lb fish, you probably would need to use two pots/pans.; Now if there's any Ambul Thiyal paste left, you can spread it over fish pieces. Add some curry leaves and Ceylon cinnamon pieces. (Ceylon cinnamon comes as a roll of few cinnamon barks. Break it and use it); Cover and cook on very low heat until the fish pieces oozes out water and they're mostly cooked. At this point, you can taste the liquid and decide if you want to add any more salt. I like to turn all the pieces upside down. You can totally skip this process if you want. Carefully lift each piece using a fork or spoon and turn them, one piece at a time.; Reduce the heat to the lowest setting, and cook until all the water is evaporated. Let them completely cool down in the pot before you store it. There should be no moisture left when it cools down. The low moisture helps to keep fish Ambul Thiyal pieces longer without going bad.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/sri-lankan-fish-ambul-thiyal/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Chicken Dum Biryani (Pakki style),Fool-proof pakki style Hydrabadi Chicken Dum Biryani. Tender and juicy chicken layered with aromatic basmati and steamed to perfection.,There are a few cons and pros to both of these methods. The kacchi (raw) style definitely takes longer to make. You need at least 12hours of meat marination and then you need to cook it with steam for longer until the meat is cooked. But the hands-on time is very short since you cook it only once. And I can guarantee that you’re going to have melt-in-your-mouth tender meat at the end because of the longer marination in yogurt. The yogurt helps to breakdown the proteins and make the meat super moist and tender. Please refer to my,Beginner,,650gbone-in chicken (about 5 drumsticks); 3⁄4cupplain full fat yogurt(room temp if possible); 1cuponion thinly sliced (130g); 3green chilies; 1tbspghee; 1⁄2tbspcooking oil; 1tomato diced (125g); 1tbspginger garlic paste; 1tbspBiryani masala powder; 1tspKashmiri red chili powder; 1tspcayenne powder/red chili powder; 1⁄4tspturmeric powder; 1⁄3cupcilantro chopped; 1⁄4cupmint chopped; 1⁄2tsplime juice((optional)); 1⁄4cupwater; 11⁄2cupBasmati Rice; 1tspghee; 1⁄4tspcumin seeds; 3cardomom; 3cloves; 1cinnamon stick; 2bay leaf; 2.5lwater (approximately); salt (a lot)(refer notes above); 2tspghee; 2dropyellow food coloring or few safron strands; 1tbspmilk; 1⁄3cupgolden fried onion for layering and garnish; some cilantro leaves; some mint leaves,"Get a wide pot and add ghee and oil to heat up. Add your thinly sliced onion and fry them until they are brown, on medium heat. Mix time to time to ensure even frying. Do not wait until the onions burn which can make the curry bitter.; When onions are brown, add ginger garlic paste and mix well together. Lower the heat and cover if it splatters. Fry until the raw smell goes away.; Now add your diced tomatoes. Mix well together.; Cook the tomatoes until they're very mushy. Use the back of the spoon to mash them a little bit.; To that, add biryani masala powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, cayenne powder, turmeric powder, salt, and green chilies broken into big pieces.; Toast the spices with onions for about a minute in low heat.; Now add the chicken pieces and mix well together. Let the chicken pieces sear a bit.; Turn off the heat and add your yogurt. Make sure to beat the yogurt with a spoon to break the lumps and to make it smooth.; Mix well with the chicken, turn on the heat to medium-low and add 1/4 cup of water and mix.; Cover it and cook it until the oil separates from the curry. (While the chicken is cooking, you can also start washing and soaking the rice. Check the instructions on the next section); When the oil has separated in the curry, add cilantro, and mint leaves. Mix and cook for another few minutes.; After a few minutes, taste the gravy and see if it has enough salt. Adjust salt if needed.; Cover again and cook on medium-low heat until there's very little gravy left. (about 1/4 cup); When the curry is done, turn off the heat and add 1/2 tsp of lime juice and mix well. If the curry is already sour enough for you with the yogurt then you can skip adding lime.; Meanwhile, you make the chicken, wash your Basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Then soak the rice in water for about 15mins.; Heat about 2.5l of water in a large pot. To that add cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, ghee, and salt. Taste the water. It should taste pretty salty. Otherwise, your rice will end up bland. Let the water come to boil.; Add the rice and cook it until they're almost done (about 90%). To test that take a few rice grains out and taste. The rice grains have to be cooked all the way through but they have to be firm when you bite.; When the rice is 90% done, immediately drain the rice using a colander. Spread the rice in the colander so the steam can escape and it would slow down further cooking.; Now layer the rice on top of the chicken you made earlier. Do not press the rice with the spoon. The grains have to be nice and loose.; Mix milk and yellow food color in a small bowl. And pour the yellow milk around the layered rice. Also, add ghee, some of your fried onion, some of the cilantro, and mint leaves on the top of the rice.; Cover your pot tightly with an aluminum foil and close with a tight-fitting lid to stop steam from leaking.; Cook for about 4 mins on medium-high heat. Then set the flame/heat to the lowest setting and cook for another 15 mins. Turn off the heat and leave for another 15mins before you open it.; Serve without over mixing the rice with chicken.  Garnish with rest of the fried onion, cilantro, and mint. Serve with boiled eggs, yogurt or raita.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Non Vegetarian, Non VegetarianSpicy, Spicy, veganVeganVegetarian Meals",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/chicken-dum-biryani-pakki-style/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Chicken Dum Biryani (Pakki style),Fool-proof pakki style Hydrabadi Chicken Dum Biryani. Tender and juicy chicken layered with aromatic basmati and steamed to perfection.,There are a few cons and pros to both of these methods. The kacchi (raw) style definitely takes longer to make. You need at least 12hours of meat marination and then you need to cook it with steam for longer until the meat is cooked. But the hands-on time is very short since you cook it only once. And I can guarantee that you’re going to have melt-in-your-mouth tender meat at the end because of the longer marination in yogurt. The yogurt helps to breakdown the proteins and make the meat super moist and tender. Please refer to my,Beginner,,650gbone-in chicken (about 5 drumsticks); 3⁄4cupplain full fat yogurt(room temp if possible); 1cuponion thinly sliced (130g); 3green chilies; 1tbspghee; 1⁄2tbspcooking oil; 1tomato diced (125g); 1tbspginger garlic paste; 1tbspBiryani masala powder; 1tspKashmiri red chili powder; 1tspcayenne powder/red chili powder; 1⁄4tspturmeric powder; 1⁄3cupcilantro chopped; 1⁄4cupmint chopped; 1⁄2tsplime juice((optional)); 1⁄4cupwater; 11⁄2cupBasmati Rice; 1tspghee; 1⁄4tspcumin seeds; 3cardomom; 3cloves; 1cinnamon stick; 2bay leaf; 2.5lwater (approximately); salt (a lot)(refer notes above); 2tspghee; 2dropyellow food coloring or few safron strands; 1tbspmilk; 1⁄3cupgolden fried onion for layering and garnish; some cilantro leaves; some mint leaves,"Get a wide pot and add ghee and oil to heat up. Add your thinly sliced onion and fry them until they are brown, on medium heat. Mix time to time to ensure even frying. Do not wait until the onions burn which can make the curry bitter.; When onions are brown, add ginger garlic paste and mix well together. Lower the heat and cover if it splatters. Fry until the raw smell goes away.; Now add your diced tomatoes. Mix well together.; Cook the tomatoes until they're very mushy. Use the back of the spoon to mash them a little bit.; To that, add biryani masala powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, cayenne powder, turmeric powder, salt, and green chilies broken into big pieces.; Toast the spices with onions for about a minute in low heat.; Now add the chicken pieces and mix well together. Let the chicken pieces sear a bit.; Turn off the heat and add your yogurt. Make sure to beat the yogurt with a spoon to break the lumps and to make it smooth.; Mix well with the chicken, turn on the heat to medium-low and add 1/4 cup of water and mix.; Cover it and cook it until the oil separates from the curry. (While the chicken is cooking, you can also start washing and soaking the rice. Check the instructions on the next section); When the oil has separated in the curry, add cilantro, and mint leaves. Mix and cook for another few minutes.; After a few minutes, taste the gravy and see if it has enough salt. Adjust salt if needed.; Cover again and cook on medium-low heat until there's very little gravy left. (about 1/4 cup); When the curry is done, turn off the heat and add 1/2 tsp of lime juice and mix well. If the curry is already sour enough for you with the yogurt then you can skip adding lime.; Meanwhile, you make the chicken, wash your Basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Then soak the rice in water for about 15mins.; Heat about 2.5l of water in a large pot. To that add cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, ghee, and salt. Taste the water. It should taste pretty salty. Otherwise, your rice will end up bland. Let the water come to boil.; Add the rice and cook it until they're almost done (about 90%). To test that take a few rice grains out and taste. The rice grains have to be cooked all the way through but they have to be firm when you bite.; When the rice is 90% done, immediately drain the rice using a colander. Spread the rice in the colander so the steam can escape and it would slow down further cooking.; Now layer the rice on top of the chicken you made earlier. Do not press the rice with the spoon. The grains have to be nice and loose.; Mix milk and yellow food color in a small bowl. And pour the yellow milk around the layered rice. Also, add ghee, some of your fried onion, some of the cilantro, and mint leaves on the top of the rice.; Cover your pot tightly with an aluminum foil and close with a tight-fitting lid to stop steam from leaking.; Cook for about 4 mins on medium-high heat. Then set the flame/heat to the lowest setting and cook for another 15 mins. Turn off the heat and leave for another 15mins before you open it.; Serve without over mixing the rice with chicken.  Garnish with rest of the fried onion, cilantro, and mint. Serve with boiled eggs, yogurt or raita.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Non Vegetarian, Non VegetarianSpicy, Spicy, veganVeganVegetarian Meals",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/chicken-dum-biryani-pakki-style/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

The Best Sri Lankan Coconut Roti,This is the only recipe you need for the best Sri Lankan coconut roti. And possibly the easiest flatbread recipe you'd ever find in the world,"Yes, Once you knead the dough, make the balls and put it into the fringe, covered. It can last in the fridge for one to two days with no problem. Take them out and make the roti whenever you’re ready. The dough can also stay on the counter for 1 -2 hours depending on the room temp with no problem.",Beginner,,21⁄2cupfresh grated coconut; 21⁄2cupall purpose flour; 1.5tbspbutter; 2tbspthinly sliced shallot/onion; 1green chili(optional); 1sprig curry leaves (thinly sliced); water as needed (room temp); salt as needed,"Put the shredded coconut into a large bowl. Add softened butter, thinly sliced onion/shallot, green chili, sliced curry leaves, and salt. crush and mix well with your hands. Taste. It should taste a little salty. If not add a bit more salt and mix again. 
( The basic coconut roti only needs coconut, flour, water, and salt. You can skip all the other ingredients or use some but they add really good flavors); Add flour to the mix and carefully mix the flour with coconut mixture to coat all the coconut with flour. You can just run your fingers in a circular motion to mix them. no need to knead.; Then add water, a little by little and gently mix with your fingers to make big lumps.; When you enough water to foam some big lumps them knead the dough for about two minutes. No need to be vigorous like you make other bread varieties. You only need to make a pliable, nonsticky dough.  It doesn't have to be smooth.; Now divide the dough into 6 equal balls. If you want smaller Rotis divide the dough to 8 balls.; Using your two hands, make them into a round ball. One at a time. With this amount, you can make 6 balls. Keep them covered until you make them. (see the description for storing/freezing options); Now, on a clean flat surface, apply some coconut oil. You can a flat plate, a tray, a banana leaf, or even your clean countertop. Put one ball in, flat it out until you get about 3/4cm to 1cm thickness. Don't make it too thin, the Rotis would dry out and turn into a biscuity texture. If you roll them thick, then you might end up with a raw middle.; Heat a roti pan, or a cast-iron skillet (these are the best options but any other pan would also work). Lay a roti and cook about a minute or until you get nice char marks.; Then flip and cook again until it's cooked all the way through. When it's done transfer into a cooling rack. While one roti is cooking you can flat out the next roti.","Recipe Keys:veganVeganVegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non VegetarianSpicy, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/the-best-sri-lankan-coconut-roti/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Add chopped garlic, chopped onion, green chilies and fry until onions get sweaty. Then add the diced carrot and some salt. Cook on medium until carrots are cooked all the way through. Then move the veggies to a side of the pan and add the chili flakes. mix and toast a bit and add the onion and carrot mixture. Add your potatoes. stir fry a bit and add the drained tuna. (You can use canned mackerel too but the taste and smell would be different.) Break with the spoon and stirfry for about a minute. Add the chopped leeks. Mix and well. If you feel like the mixture is too dry, add about a tsp of water and stir. Turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool down.; Whisk flour water and salt together and make a smooth somewhat thin batter (a little thinner than heavy whipping cream). You can use your blender too to mix the batter.; Heat a nonstick skillet or nonstick hopper pan (which is what I use). Brush a thin coating of oil using a paper tissue. Add about 1/3 cup of batter and swirl the pan to spread it evenly. Cook for about 30seconds to a minute or until it's cooked all the way through. (cover the pan if you use a nonstick hopper pan. If you feel like the pancakes are thick and not flexible, add a bit of water, a tbsp at a time, and thin it out. What you need is a very thin and flexible pancake.; Carefully transfer the pancake into a plate. Do not flip. Add 3 - 4 tbsp of filling in the middle. Also, place half of a boiled egg on the top. If you can roughly arrange the filling as a triangle, it would be easier in the next step.
(Meanwhile, you can make another pancake too. Then you can do this whole process like a production line); Fold from three corners to the middle to make it into a triangle. Check out the photo. Try not to leave much air inside the roll when you fold it. (why? read the tips on the recipe description); Dust a tray/plate with flour and place the roll. Do this whole process to all the rolls. Do not stack them.; add a cup of flour and a little less than a cup of water, and a bit of salt to a bowl and make another batter. If you have any leftover batter from the pancake making, you can use the same batter for coating too. Also, put breadcrumbs into a plate.; Now using tongs or one hand, dip one egg roll in the batter. And lift and hold it to remove any excess dripping batter. Transfer the eggroll to the breadcrumb plate, and coat well with breadcrumbs. Lift the roll and shake to remove any excess breadcrumbs and pat with your hand so that breadcrumbs stick to the pancake very well. Place it back on the tray/plate.
If the breadcrumbs you're using are very fine and powdery, do this coating process one more time to double coat the egg rolls.; Now if you have time, refrigerate the egg rolls in the fridge for about an hour or up until you're ready to fry them. If you're out of time, at least let them rest until the batter you use to coat dries out. As the batter dries out, the breadcrumbs stick to the pancake pretty nicely.; Heat oil in a deep vessel/pot. put a piece of a batter+breadcrumb piece and see if it floats immediately. If it floats then the oil is ready. Fry the egg rolls in hot oil. Make sure to flip them frequently to ensure even heat distribution. Also, be generous with the oil. Do not overcrowd the pan as the rolls drop the oil temp significantly. And add one roll at a time and let it fry for about 30 seconds before you add the next one. 
Put them on a paper towel after frying to remove excess water. Let them cool down on a cooling rack if you want to keep them crispy for longer.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Vegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/sri-lankan-egg-rolls/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

An amazing snack.,Refrigerate breaded chicken cheese balls for 2 hours. Which makes the batter dries out and bread crumbs to stick to the balls better.

If you don’t have a food processor, grind the habanero first in a mortar and pestle and add that to everything else and mix with your hands. Make sure to use kitchen gloves.; Make lime size balls. These do not have to be perfectly round. Now flat teach ball into a disc-like shape. Put a mozzarella cube in. Fold the edges of the disc inside and completely cover the mozzarella cube with the meat filling.; Roll between your palms to make it into a tight ball. No air should be left inside. Oil your hands if the filling sticks on to hands.The surface of the ball should be smooth. And the meat filling should cover the mozzarella cube completely. You can Make 10 balls out of the amount I have given above.; Make a thick batter using some flour water and salt. Or you could use beaten eggs too. Arrange bread crumbs in a separate container. Then dip one ball at a time in the batter. Use a fork for this for easier handling. Then roll it on bread crumbs and cover the balls evenly. Gently press breadcrumbs with your hands to the ball to ensure that they stick to the ball. Do this to all the balls and lay them on a plate.; Do this breading process one more time with all the balls. Double coating is so important in this recipe.; Then arrange all the breaded balls on a plate with some space in between and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. This helps dry out the batter so the breadcrumbs adhere better to the meatball. This process also dries out the surface of the balls, which makes it quicker to fry.; Heat oil in a deep pan or fryer. Add a generous amount of oil for deep frying. 
Fry the chicken cheese balls until they are golden brown. Keep turning them frequently in the oil to get even browning.

If the batter is thick, add more water, a little at a time, and whisk. There should be no lumps in the batter. You can use a blender to mix this too.
Heat a small nonstick pan. I use a nonstick hopper pan. add a drop of oil and rub it all over the pan using a paper towel. you just need a super-thin coating of oil. Pour the batter using a large spoon or a ladle and swirl the pan in a circular motion so the batter can spread throughout the pan evenly. Pancake has to be very thin so don’t put too much batter. 
Cover and cook for about a minute until it’s cooked but still flexible. Do not wait until they get crispy.  
(If you got any leftover pancake batter, do not throw away. Use it for Breading.); Now put the pancake on a plate. Put about 3 tbsp of filling and fold three side edges to the middle and roll it over to make a cylindrical shape roll. Make sure you dust with some flour to avoid them from sticking together.  Go to my fish rolls recipe to see the step by step photos on wrapping.; Dip a roll in the batter, lift and let the excess batter fall back in and then place in the breadcrumbs. Use tongs for easy handling. Cover well with breadcrumbs.  Put on a clean dry plate. Do this to one roll at a time. Repeat the breading process one more time. Since you put cheese in the filling it's important to have a nice thick coating. 

After double-breading, put them in the fridge to dry out for about two hours or so. This dries out the batter you used for breading which ensures they keep in place. You can fry them whenever you want. But make sure they are nicely dried.; Heat oil in a deep fryer or in a pan. When the oil is hot, fry rolls until they are golden brown. You have to fry them as quickly as possible to avoid bursting. Make sure you flip them frequently.  And don’t overcrowd the pan. I only fry about two rolls at a time. Serve hot when the cheese inside is still soft and melted.","Recipe Keys:Non VegetarianSpicy, Non Vegetarian, Spicy, veganVeganVegetarian Meals",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/crispy-chicken-rolls-with-habanero-and-cheese/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Chicken Dum Biryani (Pakki style),Fool-proof pakki style Hydrabadi Chicken Dum Biryani. Tender and juicy chicken layered with aromatic basmati and steamed to perfection.,There are a few cons and pros to both of these methods. The kacchi (raw) style definitely takes longer to make. You need at least 12hours of meat marination and then you need to cook it with steam for longer until the meat is cooked. But the hands-on time is very short since you cook it only once. And I can guarantee that you’re going to have melt-in-your-mouth tender meat at the end because of the longer marination in yogurt. The yogurt helps to breakdown the proteins and make the meat super moist and tender.

Add your thinly sliced onion and fry them until they are brown, on medium heat. Mix time to time to ensure even frying. Do not wait until the onions burn which can make the curry bitter.; When onions are brown, add ginger garlic paste and mix well together. Lower the heat and cover if it splatters. Fry until the raw smell goes away.; Now add your diced tomatoes. Mix well together.; Cook the tomatoes until they're very mushy. Use the back of the spoon to mash them a little bit.; To that, add biryani masala powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, cayenne powder, turmeric powder, salt, and green chilies broken into big pieces.; Toast the spices with onions for about a minute in low heat.; Now add the chicken pieces and mix well together. Let the chicken pieces sear a bit.; Turn off the heat and add your yogurt. Make sure to beat the yogurt with a spoon to break the lumps and to make it smooth.; Mix well with the chicken, turn on the heat to medium-low and add 1/4 cup of water and mix.; Cover it and cook it until the oil separates from the curry. (While the chicken is cooking, you can also start washing and soaking the rice. Check the instructions on the next section); When the oil has separated in the curry, add cilantro, and mint leaves. Mix and cook for another few minutes.; After a few minutes, taste the gravy and see if it has enough salt. Adjust salt if needed.; Cover again and cook on medium-low heat until there's very little gravy left. (about 1/4 cup); When the curry is done, turn off the heat and add 1/2 tsp of lime juice and mix well. If the curry is already sour enough for you with the yogurt then you can skip adding lime.; Meanwhile, you make the chicken, wash your Basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Then soak the rice in water for about 15mins.; Heat about 2.5l of water in a large pot. To that add cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, ghee, and salt. Taste the water. It should taste pretty salty. Otherwise, your rice will end up bland. Let the water come to boil.; Add the rice and cook it until they're almost done (about 90%). To test that take a few rice grains out and taste. The rice grains have to be cooked all the way through but they have to be firm when you bite.; When the rice is 90% done, immediately drain the rice using a colander. Spread the rice in the colander so the steam can escape and it would slow down further cooking.; Now layer the rice on top of the chicken you made earlier. Do not press the rice with the spoon. The grains have to be nice and loose.; Mix milk and yellow food color in a small bowl. And pour the yellow milk around the layered rice. Also, add ghee, some of your fried onion, some of the cilantro, and mint leaves on the top of the rice.; Cover your pot tightly with an aluminum foil and close with a tight-fitting lid to stop steam from leaking.; Cook for about 4 mins on medium-high heat. Then set the flame/heat to the lowest setting and cook for another 15 mins. Turn off the heat and leave for another 15mins before you open it.; Serve without over mixing the rice with chicken.

The Best Sri Lankan Coconut Roti,This is the only recipe you need for the best Sri Lankan coconut roti. And possibly the easiest flatbread recipe you'd ever find in the world,"Yes, Once you knead the dough, make the balls and put it into the fringe, covered. It can last in the fridge for one to two days with no problem. Take them out and make the roti whenever you’re ready. The dough can also stay on the counter for 1 -2 hours depending on the room temp with no problem.",Beginner,,21⁄2cupfresh grated coconut; 21⁄2cupall purpose flour; 1.5tbspbutter; 2tbspthinly sliced shallot/onion; 1green chili(optional); 1sprig curry leaves (thinly sliced); water as needed (room temp); salt as needed,"Put the shredded coconut into a large bowl. Add softened butter, thinly sliced onion/shallot, green chili, sliced curry leaves, and salt. crush and mix well with your hands. Taste. It should taste a little salty. If not add a bit more salt and mix again. 
( The basic coconut roti only needs coconut, flour, water, and salt. You can skip all the other ingredients or use some but they add really good flavors); Add flour to the mix and carefully mix the flour with coconut mixture to coat all the coconut with flour. You can just run your fingers in a circular motion to mix them. no need to knead.; Then add water, a little by little and gently mix with your fingers to make big lumps.; When you enough water to foam some big lumps them knead the dough for about two minutes. No need to be vigorous like you make other bread varieties. You only need to make a pliable, nonsticky dough.  It doesn't have to be smooth.; Now divide the dough into 6 equal balls. If you want smaller Rotis divide the dough to 8 balls.; Using your two hands, make them into a round ball. One at a time. With this amount, you can make 6 balls. Keep them covered until you make them. (see the description for storing/freezing options); Now, on a clean flat surface, apply some coconut oil. You can a flat plate, a tray, a banana leaf, or even your clean countertop. Put one ball in, flat it out until you get about 3/4cm to 1cm thickness. Don't make it too thin, the Rotis would dry out and turn into a biscuity texture. If you roll them thick, then you might end up with a raw middle.; Heat a roti pan, or a cast-iron skillet (these are the best options but any other pan would also work). Lay a roti and cook about a minute or until you get nice char marks.; Then flip and cook again until it's cooked all the way through. When it's done transfer into a cooling rack. While one roti is cooking you can flat out the next roti.","Recipe Keys:veganVeganVegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non VegetarianSpicy, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/the-best-sri-lankan-coconut-roti/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg

Add chopped garlic, chopped onion, green chilies and fry until onions get sweaty. Then add the diced carrot and some salt. Cook on medium until carrots are cooked all the way through. Then move the veggies to a side of the pan and add the chili flakes. mix and toast a bit and add the onion and carrot mixture. Add your potatoes. stir fry a bit and add the drained tuna. (You can use canned mackerel too but the taste and smell would be different.) Break with the spoon and stirfry for about a minute. Add the chopped leeks. Mix and well. If you feel like the mixture is too dry, add about a tsp of water and stir. Turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool down.; Whisk flour water and salt together and make a smooth somewhat thin batter (a little thinner than heavy whipping cream). You can use your blender too to mix the batter.; Heat a nonstick skillet or nonstick hopper pan (which is what I use). Brush a thin coating of oil using a paper tissue. Add about 1/3 cup of batter and swirl the pan to spread it evenly. Cook for about 30seconds to a minute or until it's cooked all the way through. (cover the pan if you use a nonstick hopper pan. If you feel like the pancakes are thick and not flexible, add a bit of water, a tbsp at a time, and thin it out. What you need is a very thin and flexible pancake.; Carefully transfer the pancake into a plate. Do not flip. Add 3 - 4 tbsp of filling in the middle. Also, place half of a boiled egg on the top. If you can roughly arrange the filling as a triangle, it would be easier in the next step.
(Meanwhile, you can make another pancake too. Then you can do this whole process like a production line); Fold from three corners to the middle to make it into a triangle. Check out the photo. Try not to leave much air inside the roll when you fold it. (why? read the tips on the recipe description); Dust a tray/plate with flour and place the roll. Do this whole process to all the rolls. Do not stack them.; add a cup of flour and a little less than a cup of water, and a bit of salt to a bowl and make another batter. If you have any leftover batter from the pancake making, you can use the same batter for coating too. Also, put breadcrumbs into a plate.; Now using tongs or one hand, dip one egg roll in the batter. And lift and hold it to remove any excess dripping batter. Transfer the eggroll to the breadcrumb plate, and coat well with breadcrumbs. Lift the roll and shake to remove any excess breadcrumbs and pat with your hand so that breadcrumbs stick to the pancake very well. Place it back on the tray/plate.
If the breadcrumbs you're using are very fine and powdery, do this coating process one more time to double coat the egg rolls.; Now if you have time, refrigerate the egg rolls in the fridge for about an hour or up until you're ready to fry them. If you're out of time, at least let them rest until the batter you use to coat dries out. As the batter dries out, the breadcrumbs stick to the pancake pretty nicely.; Heat oil in a deep vessel/pot. put a piece of a batter+breadcrumb piece and see if it floats immediately. If it floats then the oil is ready. Fry the egg rolls in hot oil. Make sure to flip them frequently to ensure even heat distribution. Also, be generous with the oil. Do not overcrowd the pan as the rolls drop the oil temp significantly. And add one roll at a time and let it fry for about 30 seconds before you add the next one. 
Put them on a paper towel after frying to remove excess water. Let them cool down on a cooling rack if you want to keep them crispy for longer.","Recipe Keys:Non Vegetarian, Vegetarian Meals, veganVeganVegetarian Meals, Non Vegetarian, Spicy",https://www.hungrylankan.com/recipes/sri-lankan-egg-rolls/,https://www.hungrylankan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527_183854_0000.jpg
