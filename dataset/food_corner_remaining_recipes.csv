Traditionally the wrapping for Chinese rolls are pan cakes.; Below is how to make pancake wraps.; First, sieve all-purpose flour & baking powder together into a bowl.; Add beaten egg into this & whisk well.; Gradually add milk and make the pan cake batter. Avoid any lumps.; Adjust salt & add a pinch of turmeric.; Whisk well again. Keep the batter aside for about 10-15 minutes.; Step 2: Make the filling:; First boil potatoes; Peel the skin and roughly cut into cubes.; Drain the can of tuna.; Heat oil in a frying pan,when oil is hot add mustard seeds.; When mustard seeds start to pop out, add onions, green chili and curry leaves.; Stir until the onions are tender and start to emit aroma.; Then add tuna and cubed potatoes.; Allow to cook for a few minutes.; Then add salt, crushed pepper, chili powder, turmeric powder and stir until all are well mixed.; Cook another few minutes and turn off heat.; Keep this mix aside and allow cooling.; Filling for Chinese Rolls is ready.; Step 3: Arrange the bread crumbs and batter; In a bowl, beat the egg.

That means, you have to cook a pan cake, spread the filling on it, make the roll ready to fill before proceeding to the next pan cake.; However, if you are quick enough, make 4-5 pancakes and spread the filling on them.; Make rolls ready to fry. Then proceed to the next pancake batch.; I used the 2ndmethod, Ah! that means I am quick!; Now, back to preparing the rolls.; Once a pancake is ready, immediately spread about a spoon of filling onto cooked pancake.; Before rolling, fold one side. Then fold two opposite sides.; After that, roll it. Please see the below pictures on how to roll these spring rolls.; Then coat this roll with plain flour which we kept aside.; After that dip in beaten egg.; Then roll it again on bread crumbs and cover the rolls with bread crumbs.; Repeat the process with remaining batter and the filling.; Prepare all the rolls for deep frying.; Step 3:Deep frying; Ah, I am really happy now. We are in the final step.; Simply heat some oil in a deep frying pan or a thachchi.; When oil is hot, deep fry the rolls.; When rolls are fried evenly and golden brown, remove those to a kitchen towel.; Allow to drain any excess oil.; Repeat with the remaining rolls.; Step 4: Serve it; Once all the Chinese rolls are deep fried, serve hot with some tomato sauce.; A ginger tea is well goes with this. That is my favourite combination.","Blogging Tips, Food & Travel, Health & Fitness, Reviews, Appetizers and Snacks",https://foodcnr.com/sri-lankan-chinese-rolls/,https://foodcnr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sri-Lankan-Rolls.jpg

However, I used only 3 eggs, also I didn’t use water. For the custard, I added sugar, you can remove it if it is too sweet. Anyway I am not a big fan of sweet treats. Still I didn’t feel this pudding is too sweet. I really don’t like to try desserts when I feel that I have to wash a lot of utensils or when I am unsure of achieving the best appearance and taste. For the below recipe, I am sure even a kid can achieve a good tasting Caramel Pudding without much effort.Also check : Marshmallow Recipe without corn syrupCaramel Pudding-using steamerCaramel Pudding can be made in oven or even in a microwave. But I want to share the","I know there are lot of Food Corner fans who are males work outside Sri Lanka and away from the family. They are with least gadgets in the kitchen as their aim is to go back to Sri Lanka after few years of working. This recipe may be a good treat for them.; Even if you don’t have a steamer, still there is a method. Read the notes at the end of the recipe.; Now here is the recipe for Caramel Pudding, the Sri Lankan Style!; Recipe : Sri Lankan Style Caramel PuddingIngredients :  ( for about 6-8 servings/enough for a 7cm dia. baking pan)for caramel:40g sugar1 tsp waterfor the custard filling:; 3 eggs1 tin sweetened condensed milk(370 g); 60g sugar1 tsp vanilla essence; MethodStep1-make caramelized sugarbase; Combine sugar and water in a saucepan and heat it.Keep watching and swirl until sugar is melted.; When it is dark brown turn off the heat.Remember,not to heat much as it will cause the caramel bitter in taste.Remove from heat when it is brown.Also no need to use a spoon and stir. Just tilt the pan and mix sugar.If you use a spoon,sugar will recrystallize and will be sticky on the spoon.; Then pour this caramelized sugar into a pudding mould or cups.I used a 7cm diameter baking pan for the above quantity.After poured the caramel into pan,rotate the pan and allow the caramel to spread over the bottom of the pan.Keep aside to cool; Step 2:Make the custard fillingBefore making the custard,pour water into the pot of steamer.Allow to boil water till we prepare the mix.; In a bowl, lightly beat the eggs until combined.However make sure not to make foamy.; Add sugar andDissolve. then gradually add milk.Mix well. Strain through a strainer to make it smooth.; Now pour the egg mixture into the caramel coated mould.; Step 3:Steam the custard/caramel pudding; Place the pudding mix in the steamer.; Close with lid. Steam for  20 minutes.; After 20 minutes, press the pudding gently .The pudding is done when the top is firm when pressed.; Stop/switch off the heat. Allow another 5 minutes to steam with the remaining heat (after switching off); Step 4:Removing the pudding; I used a tooth pick and insert it through the edges and removed the pudding from the baking pan.Before serving, place a plate over the mould.hold firmly and turn over gently. The pudding will turn over onto the plate with caramel side up!; Now pour some of the remaining caramel over the pudding and serve it.; Ok,now you will ask me where is the poured caramel in my pudding! 🙂 I didn’t pour it.I made this in day time but wanted to taste when my husband is at home. So,I didn’t pour the caramel when I took photos as I didn’t want to make it difficult to wash the serving plate.But,you can do of course! 🙂; Without using a steamer,you can steam the Caramel Pudding in a pan.; You need a pan with a lid which is bigger than the pudding mould.Place a dish towel/piece of cloth in bottom of the pan. By this you can gently steam the Puddings.Cover the pudding mould using an aluminum foil. Then place the pudding mould on pan. Slowly add hot water to the pan just about a half-inch from the bottom of the pan. Cover with the lid.

Konda Kavum recipe from Aunty Gunawathie,,written byAmila Gamage Wickramarachchi,"July 29, 2013",,,,,,(about 45 Kavum)White Rice flour 750gAll purpose flour 150gSugar 800g Coconut oil for deep frying(use other cooking oil if coconut oil is not available)Few cardamom podsSalt as required(optional) Special Utensils/toolsA wok/thachchi for deep fryingA metal piece (this is an optional/ see the video for the shape of this piece)A wooden skewer,"First prepare Rice flour using white rice; Here is how to make rice flour for Sri Lankan traditional sweets.; Soak white rice in water for 2-3 hours. Do not soak more than 3 hours.; After 2-3 hours, drain water. Spread soaked rice on a paper or a plate and allow to dry fully.; Then grind it to a fine powder.; Sift rice flour using a sieve, so that fine powder is achieved. Grind whatever remaining and sieve it again. Repeat until all rice is ground into fine powder. You can prepare rice flour one day ahead before making Konda Kavum.; Make the Konda Kavum mixture; Mix rice flour and all purpose flour. Sieve it to a bowl. Keep aside.; Heat sugar with a little water until sugar is dissolved.Remove from heat Then add the flour mixture into it slowly until all the flour has been mixed into it.Add more water as required to make this batter.; Add salt as per taste. Mix well and prepare a batter which the consistency is similar to a pan cake batter.; Preparing the Konda Kavum; Once the batter is prepared, allow it to rest for 30 minutes.; Meantime, crush cardamom pods. Add this to konda kavum mixture and mix well.; To prepare konda kavum,; Pour oil into a wok/thachchi for deep frying kavum.; Heat oil.Check the metal piece in thachchi.Also see the notes below.; Then add a spoonful of batter (around ¼ cup) into the centre of wok. Let it cook. Halfway, use the wooden skewer and gently press the centre of kavum. At this time, the uncooked batter will come up. Using spoon/ladle pour hot oil over the batter. Same time turn and lift the skewer. Actually this is to shape the top part of Konda kavum. Pour oil continuously till the kavum is fried and golden brown.; Remove kavum onto a paper towel and allow to drain oil.; Continue the same procedure with the remaining batter.; Watch this video on how to cook Konda Kavum once the batter is prepared.Please ignore the quality of the video,I just recorded as it is easy to explain how to cook Konda Kavum; You can add batter directly to hot oil and shape it to a konda kavum. However this needs some skill.; I found aunty Gunawathie used a small metal piece inside the wok. Then she added batter into this metal piece and shaped the kavum. As per her, this is really easy to get the shape.; Anyway, how to find this type of metal mould/metal piece for cooking konda kavum? This is her tip. There are metal spoons in the market. Buy one and simply remove the handle. So simple, but makes it easier to cook konda kavum and still it looks very nice.Nicer and looks like a professional did.; Here is my tip:Why don’t you try a metal tart mould to replace this metal piece?If you can remove the handle from a spoon,it is fine.But if it is not easy,try a cupcake mould or tart mould.I am going to try this with a tart mould.Wait for my recipe with some more cooking tips on how to cook konda kavum.; Hope you enjoyed this post.Try konda kavum for this April New Year and let me know how it is….; Keep in touch,I am planning to share few Sri Lankan traditional sweets for this April New Year.Hope I will be able to share at least few more recipes!; See the above picture,it shows inside of Konda Kavum.These Kavum were so delicious and spongy.So I thought of sharing a photo of inside too.","Blogging Tips, Food & Travel, Health & Fitness, Reviews, Sweets",https://foodcnr.com/konda-kavum-recipe-from-aunty-gunawathie/,https://foodcnr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Avurudu-Recipes-Sri-Lanka.jpg

Banana flower fry (Kesel Muwa),"Banana flower fry (Kesel Muwa),banana flower stir fry or in Sri Lankan way, it is kesel muwa thel dala,Recipe for Sri Lankan Banana flower fry (Kesel Muwa),How to cut & clean a banana blossom,How to clean kesel muwa,",written byAmila Gamage Wickramarachchi,"December 30, 2013",,,,,,"for Sri Lankans to cook it as a stir fry or in a curry. Even we cook this as banana flower pickle or as a seeni sambal. I usually buy banana blossom (kesel muwa) whenever we visit Little India to buy vegetables. Among different Sri Lankan recipes to cook banana blossom, this is one of very easy recipe, which is called banana flower stir fry or in Sri Lankan way, it is kesel muwa thel dala.How to cut & clean a banana blossom?Before cooking a banana blossom, you need to cut it and clean. However, there are few tips that you should know to keep the fresh taste of banana flower in your dish. Although there are different ways to clean a banana blossom, here is how we do usually in Sri Lanka.At this time, I don’t have step by step photos to show how to clean a banana blossom, because whenever I do cleaning or preparing banana flower recipe, it is bit difficult to do the photographing at the same time. Doing quickly is important to avoid the bitter taste or dicolouring of banana blossom.So here are the few steps to clean a banana blossom.When you take a banana blossom, you’ll see there are lots of leaves covered tightly around the small blossoms. Outer leaves are usually maroon in colour. Also these maroon leaves are not delicious in a curry or in any recipe.So, remove the dark maroon leaves till you reach the inner soft light colour thing. With my experience in Sri Lankan cooking we discard the rough maroon leaves (matured leaves) till we reach the soft leaves. Then we start cutting/slicing. In this way, we use most of the banana blossom and discard few leaves (most of the time 3-4) depending on the quality of banana blossom. However I’ve found that in some cuisine such as Indian, Thai, they discard almost all maroon leaves till they reach the white part. So, that is up to you to decide until when you want to discard the maroon leaves.When you remove maroon leaves, you’ll find small yellowish blossoms. Don’t discard those blossoms; you can still add these blossoms into your recipe.  Once you removed all matured leaves, now it is time to cut/slice banana flower.In a bowl add some water and squeeze lime juice into it.Now slice your banana flower and add those into the water bowl with lemon juice. This is to avoid discolouring of banana blossom.  After slicing the entire banana blossoms and leaves, squeeze water and prepare it for cooking.To cook this banana flower stir fry recipe, add pinch of turmeric powder to the sliced banana flower and mix well. Keep it aside.Banana flower fry (Kesel Muwa)Here is the recipe for banana flower fry.Recipe for Sri Lankan Banana flower fry (Kesel Muwa)Ingredients1 small size banana flower  1 tomato cut in to slices 1 tsp chilly powder  1/2 tsp Curry powder  2 green chilly -cut into pieces  1/2 tsp turmeric powder  1 tsp mustard seeds  1 piece cinnamon  1 big onion chopped  Few curry leaves  Rampe/Pandan leaf 1-2 inch piece  2 tbs oil  Salt to taste  1 tsp Maldive fish (optional)½ cup thick coconut milk (optional)","Wash & cut banana flower in to small pieces and add to water with lime juice while cutting.After finish cutting,squeeze banana flower in water using hands & remove water.Then add ¼ tsp Tumeric powder and mix well.Keep aside.Heat the panAdd oil to itWhen oil is hot, add mustard seeds & when mustard seeds are popping up, add cinnamon & Mix wellThen add onion sliced.
