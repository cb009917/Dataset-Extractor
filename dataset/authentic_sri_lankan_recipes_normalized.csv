I used to watch his cooking shows and learned a lot. Chef Zakir was an expert on Pakistani cuisine as well as international cuisine. He passed away in April of this year. Chapli kabab are thin ground beef patties made with aromatics and spices. Unlike your usual grilled kababs, Chapli Kababs are fried so they’re browned on the outside and tender on the inside. Chapli Kabab have a unique flavour, with ingredients like dried pomegranate seeds (anardana) to lend them a slight tang and coarsely ground coriander to enhance their already crispy exterior. Authentic Chapli Kababs are typically a medium to large flat patty, weighing around 75-100 grams per piece. They are typically about 1-2 inches in thickness. One of the characteristic features of Peshawari Chapli Kebab is its traditional cooking technique, which involves shallow (almost deep) frying the kebabs in a pan rather than grilling them. The name “chapli” is derived from the Pahto word “chaprikh/chaplet” which means “flat” and alludes to the flat, round and flattened shape of the kabab. Originally a delicacy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, in the city of Peshawar, they are now a popular street food and restaurant favourite throughout Pakistan.

I used to watch his cooking shows and learned a lot. Chef Zakir was an expert on Pakistani cuisine as well as international cuisine. He passed away in April of this year. Chapli kabab are thin ground beef patties made with aromatics and spices. Unlike your usual grilled kababs, Chapli Kababs are fried so they’re browned on the outside and tender on the inside. Chapli Kabab have a unique flavour, with ingredients like dried pomegranate seeds (anardana) to lend them a slight tang and coarsely ground coriander to enhance their already crispy exterior. Authentic Chapli Kababs are typically a medium to large flat patty, weighing around 75-100 grams per piece. They are typically about 1-2 inches in thickness. One of the characteristic features of Peshawari Chapli Kebab is its traditional cooking technique, which involves shallow (almost deep) frying the kebabs in a pan rather than grilling them. The name “chapli” is derived from the Pahto word “chaprikh/chaplet” which means “flat” and alludes to the flat, round and flattened shape of the kabab. Originally a delicacy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, in the city of Peshawar, they are now a popular street food and restaurant favourite throughout Pakistan.
