      "Chapli kabab Chapli kabab Today I am sharing the recipe of chapli kabab by one of my favourite chefs, the late Chef Zakir. I used to watch his cooking shows and learned a lot. Chef Zakir was an expert on Pakistani cuisine as well as international cuisine. He passed away in April of this year. Chapli kabab are thin ground beef patties made with aromatics and spices. Unlike your usual grilled kababs, Chapli Kababs are fried so they’re browned on the outside and tender on the inside. Chapli Kabab have a unique flavour, with ingredients like dried pomegranate seeds (anardana) to lend them a slight tang and coarsely ground coriander to enhance their already crispy exterior. Authentic Chapli Kababs are typically a medium to large flat patty, weighing around 75-100 grams per piece. They are typically about 1-2 inches in thickness. One of the characteristic features of Peshawari Chapli Kebab is its traditional cooking technique, which involves shallow (almost deep) frying the kebabs in a pan rather than grilling them. The name “chapli” is derived from the Pahto word “chaprikh/chaplet” which means “flat” and alludes to the flat, round and flattened shape of the kabab. Originally a delicacy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, in the city of Peshawar, they are now a popular street food and restaurant favourite throughout Pakistan. The dish’s rich history and unique flavor profile make it a favorite among food enthusiasts looking to experience the traditional flavors of the region. #june2026 Sarvat Hanif"

But brown rice is higher in magnesium and other minerals. It also has more fiber. For example, a cup of white long-grain rice contains just one gram of fiber, whereas a cup of brown rice contains four. - But it is so chewy and takes more time to cook. I usually mix them with whites. That the reason you soak them, longer you keep them in water shorter time to cook. I used Goya brand rice. If you make 1 cup rice , use 1 and 1/2 cup of water/ broth.

The amounts listed here are enough to bake 1 cake in a medium to large sized rice cooker that can prepare 900 ml of uncooked rice at most. There aren't any hints in particular! Even if you're a lazy baker, the cake will still puff up. If you want to be more diligent, please try sifting the flour or beating the eggs more, to make the cake puffier and lighter.

      "Okra(Lady finger) with DaL(Lentil) Curry Okra(Lady finger) with DaL(Lentil) Curry #dalcurry Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus), is known in many countries as ladies' fingers or ochro, is a flowering plant in the mallow family. It is valued for its edible green seed pods. The geographical origin of okra is disputed, with supporters of West African, Ethiopian, and South Asian origins. Raw okra is 90% water, 2% protein, 7% carbohydrates and negligible fat. In a 100 gram amount, raw okra is rich (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) in dietary fiber, vitamin C and vitamin Ke, with moderate contents of thiamin, folate and magnesium. Today am going to share a delicious recipe with this okra and Lentil. It's a dal curry can be eaten with steamed rice roti or paratha whatever you can. Let's cook 😊. [ Note - Panch phoron is a whole spice blend, used in the cuisine of Bangladesh, Eastern India and Southern Nepal. The name literally means \"five spices\"( Panch Phoron in Bangladeshi Language) and is also known as in; Maithili panch phoron), Nepali Padukone Masala), Assamese (pas phoṛôn) and Odia pancha phutana).] Bengali Spice 💚"

      "Egg Curry with Cauliflower Egg Curry with Cauliflower Eggs are a very good source of inexpensive, high-quality protein. Eggs are also rich sources of selenium, vitamin D, B6, B12 and minerals such as zinc, iron and copper. White eggs tend to get all the credit when it comes to egg protein. No matter how you cook an egg—poached, omelet, scrambled, fried, and hard-boiled—it will have about 6.3 grams of protein per large egg. This variation of egg curry is made using cauliflower, potato, coconut milk, evaporated low fat milk tamarind water, onion, ginger, garlic, onion and tomatoes along with eggs and that`s how you get the delicious curry. This is the quick meal recipe and a spicy dish too, however, if you wish to make less spicy, you can reduce the birds eye chillies or remove it. Egg curry is a popular Indian curry which is best enjoyed with plain rice or breads. Stay Happy and Stay healthy. SeethihaSNM",

Make sure the black rice and broth have cooled completely. This amount of water listed here is for foreign wheat flour (America, Canada etc.). If you are using domestic flour, then it might turn into a sticky dough unless you use less water than this. Leave out 2-3 tablespoons at first and please add more while checking the status of the dough. Recipe by Hiyashinsu cookpad.japan",

After a few experiments I tried adding more sugar to this recipe to improve the flavour. When steaming the bread, please make sure the steamer is steaming before adding the bread. Steaming the bread over high heat will give them a nice texture. You can make 4 muffin cups instead if you'd prefer. in that case, steam them for 15 minutes. Recipe by papiraki cookpad.japan"

I like hot Italian sausage in mine but it's also good with sweet sausage, ground beef, or even ground turkey. This is very filling and affordable. It costs under $15.00 to make. It's about the size of a family-sized lasagna dinner you find in the frozen section at the supermarket but tastier. #Fakeaway frozen lasagna. Raven"

      "California Farm Pork Loin Curry Dinner California Farm Pork Loin Curry Dinner Curry sauce is perfect for both marinading and cooking. All the flavors, and no waste. Just like in restaurants, where they ask you if you want mild, medium or hot curry, this recipe makes mild, medium or hot. The pork tenderloin is marinaded overnight, and sauteed the next day for dinner. The spiciness is from small red thai peppers: one, two or three. You can also use red chili powder: 1/4 teaspoon, 1/2 teaspoon, or 3/4 teaspoon. The marinade is turned into gravy for the meat. Mango chutney is a sweet/sour chutney, which tempers the curry. Great combination. And your dish will always be perfect, because when you taste it before serving, and it is too hot, you add yoghurt to make it milder. And if it is too mild, you add thai peppers. #CA2025 Hobby Horseman",
      "Thick Chicken Curry with Vegetables Thick Chicken Curry with Vegetables I created this dish because I wanted to eat curry, which brings out the delicious flavor and texture of the vegetables. After cutting the chicken into bite-size pieces, rub with shio-koji, and let sit for 30 minutes. (Use 1 teaspoon of shio-koji per chicken breast.) It makes the meat tender.

      "Easy Chicken Tomato Curry Easy Chicken Tomato Curry I made chicken curry (one of my favorites) in a very short time with canned tomatoes. Our family's secret seasoning combination is 1 teaspoon each of Japanese Worcestershire-style sauce and ketchup. Sautéed onion releases juices, so 200 ml of water should be enough. I like chicken breast better than thigh meat because it is healthy and it does not melt away. Even people who do not like tomatoes will like this curry. Recipe by mirimiriri cookpad.japan"

No matter how you cook an egg—poached, omelet, scrambled, fried, and hard-boiled—it will have about 6.3 grams of protein per large egg. This variation of egg curry is made using cauliflower, potato, coconut milk, evaporated low fat milk tamarind water, onion, ginger, garlic, onion and tomatoes along with eggs and that`s how you get the delicious curry. This is the quick meal recipe and a spicy dish too, however, if you wish to make less spicy, you can reduce the birds eye chillies or remove it.

The thick one is a little tricky to make. It may not flow as smoothly as the liquidish one does so it takes some luck and patience.

      "Butter egg brown rice 黄油拌饭#mommasrecipes Butter egg brown rice 黄油拌饭#mommasrecipes This is a simple yet gorgeous rice entree. I have included my house secrets to make the world best tasty and nutritious brown rice or multigrain rice in this recipe in two ways, traditional stove top pressure cooker version or Instant pot max version. #1 Soaking brown rice overnight in warmer climate/seasons or 24-36 hours in cooler climate/seasons is very essential for both taste and nutrition. Each batch I start from 4 cups of brown/multigrain rice, soak in a large container cover with excessive water. Change water every 8-12 hours if longer sprouting time is needed. Rinse and drain water 2 times before adding the cook water. #2 For stovetop pressure cooker, use 4 and 1/4 cup of cooking water; for Instant pot max use 3 and 3/4 cup of water. #3 Always opt in natural release regardless using a regular stovetop pressure cooker or Instant pot max. #4 Pressure is so important, 15 psi is a must, thus stovetop is better than digital pressure cooker and regular rice cooker. Instant pot Max is the model I found most close to 15psi but still a little bit shy from a stovetop one. #5 Perfect rice shall be in it's own gorgeous glossy colour, each grain shall be bouncy when you chew on it. The outer layer shall not be broken and it is accomplished via high pressure with less cooking time instead of lower temperature and pressure with long cooking time. Eat Whole 2 Thrive",

      "Easy Homemade Mango Sticky Rice (Using Rice Cooker) Easy Homemade Mango Sticky Rice (Using Rice Cooker) Actually I have shared and posted the mango sticky rice recipe some time ago, but in a different version. In my previous sticky rice recipe, I cooked it using a steamer, and I had to soak the sticky rice in water for at least 2 hours before cooking it. The time is longer than I expected. This time I will share again the Thai mango sticky rice dessert in the easiest way. Instead of cooking and steaming it into a steamer, I will just cook it in a rice cooker. It's much faster and I don't need to soak the glutinous rice first. Just cook it like the way we cook the regular rice. And also to make coconut cream sauce, I use the microwave instead of boiling it on the stove. Sounds easy right ???? So let's get straight to the recipe. Nia Hiura"

It's an everyday snack in Singapore. You can make this even without the pandan essence, in that case use green food coloring and coconut essence instead by mixing 2 teaspoons of coconut essence and adding the food coloring a little at a time. 80 g of sugar makes a cake that's not very sweet at all, so add more to taste.
